# RURL-ozdejfzl -- the shared hash-verified source resolver for tier-2 groups.
#
# WHAT A TIER-2 GROUP IS. Three of the seven groups in
# tests/testthat/fixtures/external-url-vectors.csv were imported from upstream
# JSON that this repository does NOT vendor: wpt-urltestdata,
# ada-extra-urltestdata and ada-verifydnslength. Their provenance record pins a
# revision AND a raw_source_sha256, so the bytes can be re-fetched and VERIFIED
# rather than trusted -- which is the whole reason a tier-2 verifier is possible
# at all. tools/oracle/README.md's tier table is the reference.
#
# WHY THE PINS ARE READ AND NOT COPIED. Every coordinate here comes out of
# tests/testthat/fixtures/oracle-provenance.json at run time. Hard-coding the
# revision or the digest in this file would create a second copy of the pin, and
# the record's own `no_second_copy` convention exists because a second copy is
# what drifts. It also puts the failure in the right place: change the pin in
# the record and the fetch follows it, so a pin that names bytes which do not
# exist fails HERE, loudly, instead of being discovered years later.
#
# FAIL CLOSED MEANS ABORT. If the bytes cannot be resolved -- offline, upstream
# down, a digest that does not match -- this signals a condition and the caller
# exits non-zero with the exact command a human can run. It never returns a
# partial or empty source: deriving a short block from a truncated download is
# how a gate reports PASS over an oracle it did not actually check.
#
# NO PACKAGE IS LOADED. Like every other module in this directory, there is no
# route from here to rurl's own answer. jsonlite and digest are read-only tools.

# BYTES and silently unsound for the pin: re-point a record's
# upstream_revision at a revision serving different content, leave the digest
# alone, and a warm cache hits on the digest and never fetches -- so the gate
# grades the right bytes while the revision it reports becomes a claim nothing
# checked. Measured: with a digest-only key, re-pointing this group's second
# anchor at the revision that BROKE it left the gate green. With the revision in
# the key that mutation misses the cache, fetches, and fails on the digest.

# ---- the NUL shim -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE TRAP THIS CLOSES, WHICH IS SILENT AND WOULD HAVE SCORED A CONFIDENT PASS.
# Three of the 267 wpt-urltestdata inputs contain U+0000, written as the JSON
# escape \u0000 in
# both the upstream JSON and the fixture's input_json cell. An R character
# vector CANNOT hold a NUL, and jsonlite does not error on one -- it TRUNCATES:
#
#     jsonlite::fromJSON('"sc://a\\u0000b/"')  ==>  "sc://a"
#
# So a re-location check written the obvious way compares "sc://a" on one side
# with "sc://a" on the other, agrees, and reports a pass it did not earn: after
# truncation any two inputs sharing a prefix before their NUL are equal, and the
# entire remainder of the input -- the part those three rows exist to record --
# is not compared at all.
#
# The fix is to never decode a NUL. The \u0000 ESCAPE is rewritten in the JSON
# SOURCE TEXT to \ue000 -- U+E000, a Private Use Area code point R holds
# happily -- before
# either side is parsed. The substitution is applied identically to the upstream
# bytes and to the fixture cells, so the comparison stays exact and injective;
# it is a transport encoding for the comparison only and nothing is written back.
#
# Two things make it safe, and both are asserted rather than assumed: no input
# on either side already contains U+E000 (measured: zero occurrences), and the
# escape is never itself escaped upstream (`\\u0000`, a literal backslash
# followed by "u0000", measured: zero occurrences). Either would make the
# rewrite lossy, so either aborts.
