# Re-derive the UTS-46 pin carried by the ip-obfuscation group of
# tests/testthat/fixtures/oracle-provenance.json.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. tools/oracle/derive-ip-obfuscation.R does not implement
# UTS-46. It transcribes exactly one slice of the IDNA mapping table -- the
# three full-stop variants and the ASCII uppercase mappings -- and ABORTS on
# every other non-ASCII code point rather than guessing (see
# ipobf_uts46_to_ascii). That slice is a claim about upstream DATA, and a claim
# about upstream data that nobody can re-check is exactly what let six
# fabricated section citations survive review in this group (RURL-qhwktfcw).
# So the claim is made re-derivable rather than asserted in prose.
#
# NOT A GATE, AND DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED INTO CI. It reads unicode.org over the
# network, so it cannot be a blocking step -- the pslr::psl_refresh() posture.
# tools/verify-manifest.yml names the oracle scripts it runs one by one; this
# file is not among them, and must not be added. Run it by hand when bumping the
# pin or when re-checking it:
#
#   Rscript tools/oracle/check-uts46-mapping-pin.R
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It proves the 29 transcribed mappings
# hold in every published IdnaMappingTable.txt. It does NOT verify UTS-46
# Processing -- CheckBidi, CheckJoiners, CheckHyphens, the transitional flag --
# because the derivation implements none of that and the pin does not claim it.

UTS46_BASE <- "https://www.unicode.org/Public/idna"

# Every version published under Public/idna/, WITH the sha256 of the table this
# repository verified against. Listed rather than scraped so the sweep is
# reproducible: a directory listing that changes shape would silently shrink the
# population, and a sweep that quietly checks fewer versions is the failure mode
# this file guards against.
#
# WHY THE HASHES ARE HERE AND NOT JUST THE VERSION NUMBERS. A pin that names
# only a revision does not fix BYTES. Unicode's versioned directories are meant
# to be immutable, but "meant to be" is not a check: without a recorded digest,
# an in-place edit upstream would leave this sweep re-deriving happily against
# changed content and reporting PASS -- which is the same silent-supersession
# hazard the whole normative_dependencies duty exists to detect, moved one level
# up. The digest is what makes the pin byte-exact.
#
# THIS IS NOT AN IMPORT. No upstream bytes are vendored here; a digest of what
# was checked is a verification record, not an artifact. The ip-obfuscation
# group stays section_2_3_applies = false, and nothing in the section-2.3
# contract is created or discharged by this table.
#
# Append a version AND its digest together when Unicode publishes. A red here is
# a prompt to investigate, not a breakage: check whether upstream reissued the
# file, confirm the 29 mappings still hold, then update the digest deliberately.
