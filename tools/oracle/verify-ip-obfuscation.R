# RURL-ozdejfzl -- prove the 24 `ip-obfuscation` rows are re-derivable.
#
# WHAT THIS DISCHARGES. This group carries no `generation_command` at all: it is
# recorded with `section_2_3_applies = false`, because nothing was imported and
# so there is no upstream project, revision, hash or fetch to pin. What stands
# in for that provenance is a prose claim in `oracle-provenance.json`:
#
#     "each row is a decimal/octal/hex re-encoding of an IPv4 literal,
#      derivable from arithmetic alone"   (out_of_scope_reason)
#     "the rows are re-derivable by arithmetic instead"  (relocation_note)
#
# The provenance gate accepts that sentence as written; nothing re-derived
# anything. For a group with no upstream artifact, re-derivability is the ONLY
# evidence there is, which makes it the worst place in the record for an
# untested claim. This turns it into an executable check.
#
# WHY IT LOADS NO PACKAGE. The derivation is a transcription of the WHATWG host
# parser and must stay independent of rurl. `devtools::load_all()` is
# deliberately absent, which makes the independence structural rather than a
# comment.
#
# Usage:
#   Rscript tools/oracle/verify-ip-obfuscation.R
#   Rscript tools/oracle/verify-ip-obfuscation.R --self-test
#
# Exit status 0 = the committed rows re-derive; non-zero = they do not.

# Check D -- SPEC-TRANSCRIPTION ANCHOR. Checks A-C all grade the transcription's
# CONSISTENCY with the fixture and with declared intent. None of them can tell
# you the transcription is a faithful reading of the standard: a
# uniformly-wrong host parser would satisfy all three.
#
# The group has no upstream artifact of its own to check against -- that is its
# defining property. But the repository DOES contain a WHATWG host-parsing
# corpus that is pinned: `inst/bench/wpt-url-cases.json`, at a recorded
# `upstream_revision` with a recorded `raw_source_sha256`. Grading the
# transcription against it replaces "trust this reading of the spec" with
# measured agreement from a second, datable witness.
#
# What that is NOT: WPT is an independent compatibility suite with its own
# release cadence, not a snapshot of the standard's text, so a pinned WPT
# revision is not a proxy for the WHATWG spec revision this transcription
# purports to implement. The anchor is behavioral evidence, not a spec pin, and
# it does not date the transcribed sections.
#
# This does NOT close RURL-qhwktfcw. The URL Standard is a Living Standard and
# nothing here pins a whatwg/url revision, so the anchor dates the transcription
# against a WPT revision rather than a spec revision. It also cannot cover every
# rule the transcription implements: the octal/hex/dword coercion forms are this
# group's whole subject precisely because WPT does not cover them all.
#
# Two halves, because they fail differently:
#   D1 idempotence -- every recorded `hostname` is an already-serialized,
#      spec-conformant host, so re-parsing it must return it unchanged. Catches a
#      transcription that mangles or wrongly rejects valid hosts.
#   D2 input -> host -- for inputs whose authority can be extracted without
#      transcribing the URL parser, the transcription must reproduce the recorded
#      `hostname`. Catches a coercion that lands on the wrong address.
