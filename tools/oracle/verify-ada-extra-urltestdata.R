# RURL-ozdejfzl -- prove the 24 `ada-extra-urltestdata` rows re-locate upstream.
#
# WHAT THIS DISCHARGES. The group's `generation_command` was
# MISSING[RURL-vwurxmzm], and the scratch builder that produced it,
# _scratch/build-ada-vectors.R, resolved its input through an absolute path into
# a dead session scratchpad -- un-runnable not merely from a clean checkout but
# on the machine that wrote it. Both Ada JSONs were gone from this machine when
# the port began; both were re-fetched and both hash-match the recorded digests
# exactly, which is what made this slice possible at all.
#
# THE PINNED REVISION DOES NOT REPRODUCE THIS BLOCK, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
# Upstream commit fbea5b01 (2026-07-17, ada #1186 "fix no scheme state accepting
# any input containing a fragment") changed one entry's expectation and added
# three more. The record's pin is a VERIFIED-AT pin taken after that commit, so:
#
#   - all 24 inputs re-locate at the pin, in order;
#   - ONE expected value does not (ada-024, `..#`, recorded a:b/# and now
#     `failure` upstream);
#   - FOUR upstream entries are outside the committed block, from two different
#     causes -- three added by that commit, one ("" with base about:blank) that
#     predates the import and is absent for an unrecorded reason.
#
# Both deltas are carried here as EXACT LEDGERS rather than tolerances. An
# inexact ledger ("allow up to N disagreements") would absorb the next drift
# silently, which is precisely the failure this file exists to make loud: a
# ledger entry that stops being true is as much a failure as a new one.
#
# THE SECOND ANCHOR IS WHAT MAKES THE LEDGER HONEST. A ledger alone says "we
# know about this one" without evidence that the recorded value was ever right.
# So the gate also grades the block against the revision at which it DOES
# reproduce -- and that revision was not guessed: every one of the 17 commits
# that ever touched this path was swept, and exactly one, aa8e4043 (2025-07-16),
# reproduces 24/24. Every earlier revision reproduces fewer and every later one
# 23/24.
#
# WHAT THAT BOUNDS IS UPSTREAM'S CONTENT STATE, NOT THE IMPORT (corrected in
# RURL-drkcvzex; this comment used to say "bounds the unrecorded import"). The
# bytes the block agrees with are the bytes that existed across
# [2025-07-16, 2026-07-17), and that is all. It does not resolve an import
# revision, for two independent reasons: no commit touched the path inside the
# window, so every revision in it carries the SAME bytes and no sweep could
# single one out; and content agreement is not import provenance -- a block
# produced later from an older checkout would agree exactly as well. The record
# carries this as content_state_bound, and retrieval_date stays a sentinel.
