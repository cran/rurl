# RURL-ozdejfzl -- the `ip-obfuscation` oracle, as tracked code.
#
# Ported from `_scratch/build-ipobf-vectors.R` (RURL-dbazixkr slice 3), which
# produced the 24 rows but was never in the repository: `_scratch/` is
# gitignored.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS. The DERIVATION only -- the oracle. It answers "what does
# the WHATWG URL Standard say this host parses and serializes to", and it
# answers it WITHOUT LOADING rurl. An oracle that calls the implementation it
# grades is a characterization test wearing an oracle's label, so the split is
# structural: rurl is never on the search path, so this file cannot reach
# rurl's answer even by accident. The `rurl_*` columns are a separate concern
# and are not computed here.
#
# WHAT CLAIM THIS DISCHARGES. Unlike the other six groups, `ip-obfuscation`
# records NO `generation_command` -- it carries `section_2_3_applies = false`
# because nothing was imported. What it does record, in prose, is a much
# stronger claim:
#
#     out_of_scope_reason: "each row is a decimal/octal/hex re-encoding of an
#       IPv4 literal, derivable from arithmetic alone"
#     relocation_note:     "the rows are re-derivable by arithmetic instead"
#
# That is the entire provenance argument for the group: there is no upstream
# artifact to re-locate against, so re-derivability is what stands in for one.
# Nothing tested it. This file makes it executable.
#
# THE TWO HALVES OF THE GROUP.
#
#   1. The 24 INPUTS are the irreducible data, and they travel with this file
#      as the roster below. They are hand-generated encodings, deliberately not
#      vendored from the technique references (neither cujanovic/SSRF-Testing
#      nor JorianWoltjer/ipobf ships a LICENSE), which is exactly why they
#      cannot be re-fetched from anywhere.
#   2. Every EXPECTED value is computed, never quoted -- by a transcription of
#      the WHATWG host parser (#concept-host-parser), its IPv4 parser
#      (#concept-ipv4-parser), its IPv6 parser (#concept-ipv6-parser), and the
#      two host serializers (#concept-ipv4-serializer and
#      #concept-ipv6-serializer). The first four live in URL Standard section
#      3.5 "Host parsing"; the two serializers in section 3.6 "Host
#      serializing".
#
# HOW THIS FILE CITES THE SPEC. Anchor first, section number second. Section
# NUMBERS are presentation metadata and they demonstrably drift: every citation
# in this file used to carry a number that does not resolve, and two of them
# pointed at subsections of "Host parsing" that have never existed in ANY
# revision of the standard -- it has no subsections. The anchor id (the
# fragment on https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) is what a future reader can
# actually resolve, so the anchor is the durable key and the number is the
# secondary hint. The spec revision these sections were verified against is
# pinned in tests/testthat/fixtures/oracle-provenance.json, under this group's
# `normative_dependencies`.
#
# The roster additionally declares, per IPv4 row, `denotes`: the 32-bit integer
# the encoding is INTENDED to carry, written in a notation the input does not
# use. That is a second, independent statement -- human intent -- and the
# spec arithmetic either agrees with it or does not. `ipobf-005` is the row that
# proves the check has teeth: `0x7f.256` looks like a 127.0.0.1 encoding and is
# not one, because the WHATWG 2-part form spreads 256 over the low three
# octets. It declares 2130706688 (127.0.1.0), not 2130706433.
#
# FAIL CLOSED, NEVER "failure". Where an input uses a construction this file
# does not model, it MUST abort rather than return failure. Returning failure
# for something unmodeled would coincidentally agree with the four rows whose
# expectation IS failure, and manufacture confidence out of a gap. The two
# unmodeled constructions are named at their guards below.
#
# Sourced by `tools/oracle/verify-ip-obfuscation.R`. Running it directly prints
# the derived block and writes nothing.

# The literal prefix every row's `source_reference` carries, ahead of its note.
# Kept here because it is part of what the derivation asserts about the group:
# the encodings are facts, and the upstream projects are cited for the
# TECHNIQUE only, with no bytes taken from either.
