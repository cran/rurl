# 0-255 octet acceptance + round-trip sweep.
#
# The standing rule at a host seam: any change there requires accepted counts
# AND per-row `parse_status`, per profile, plus byte-identical serialization --
# because masking a host bypasses rejection and silently WIDENS acceptance,
# which has happened in this package before (RURL-dxwxeamq, RURL-savatsuc,
# RURL-ezhzpkhg). This script is that instrument. It lived in a session
# scratchpad through the in-tree parser work and was rebuilt from scratch twice;
# it is checked in so the next host-seam change scores against the same
# corpus rather than a freshly-invented one.
#
# Usage:
#   Rscript tools/octet-acceptance-sweep.R <pkg-dir> <out.tsv>
#
# Compare two runs with plain `diff`. The three questions it answers:
#
#   locale invariance   run under LC_ALL=C and a UTF-8 locale, diff the two
#                       outputs -- must be 0 differing rows
#   behaviour delta     run at a baseline worktree and at HEAD, diff -- every
#                       differing row must be explainable
#   acceptance drift    count rows whose status is neither `error` nor NA, per
#                       profile; a RISE is a widening and needs justifying
#
# Columns are profile, label, parse_status, host, serialization, domain, tld.
# `domain`/`tld` are the L3 ANNOTATION columns and were added for RURL-jhsbzmsj
# (derive PSL annotations from the decoded reg-name view). They earn their place
# for the reason the fixed-frame trap keeps teaching: an instrument that records
# only `parse_status` can see an annotation change ONLY where it happens to flip
# the status projection, so a corpus without them scores a truthful 0 while the
# annotation moves underneath. `host` and `serialization` are the identity
# guards for that same change -- they must not move when only the annotation
# does.
#
# TWO TRAPS this harness exists to avoid, both of which produced a WRONG answer
# on a first attempt during RURL-kmpnbvdl:
#
#   1. Never round-trip the corpus through `.rds`. Under `LC_ALL=C`,
#      `readRDS()` re-encodes "unknown"-marked non-ASCII strings to UTF-8 on
#      load, so the two locale runs are silently fed DIFFERENT inputs. The
#      corpus is therefore built from raw octets in-process, and the output is
#      plain hex text.
#   2. Never wrap the whole vectorized call in one `tryCatch`. One throwing row
#      collapses the entire column into a single "THROW" and hides every other
#      row's real value -- which is precisely the defect class being measured.
#      `each()` below falls back to one call per row.

#   pct_port    a triplet followed by a real ":port" delimiter

# LITERAL HOST BYTE x STRUCTURE (RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 1, ADR 0013). Every
# block above varies the host OCTET inside a FIXED frame -- `http://` + two
# slashes + a plain remainder -- so none of them can see a rule whose gate is
# the structure AROUND the host. That was exactly the shim's shape: its
# eligibility was a regex over the whole URL, and which literal host bytes were
# admitted depended on things the host does not contain.
#
# The three frames that mattered, each of which used to REJECT a host the
# profile plainly admits, and none of which the corpus could reach:
#
#   slashes     the pattern hard-required a literal "//", so a 1- or 3-slash
#               authority never qualified (the encoded half already has
#               `pct_3slash`; the literal half had nothing)
#   terminator  the post-authority remainder was matched with an ICU ".", which
#               excludes the Unicode line terminators -- so a raw VT, FF, NEL,
#               LS or PS ANYWHERE after the authority made the row ineligible
#               and took the host down with it. This is the third instrument
#               this trap has evaded; ICU "." is not "[^\n]".

#               WHATWG special scheme -- was excluded under `whatwg` while
#               `rfc3986` allowed it

# IPv4 ADDRESS GRAMMAR x STRUCTURE (RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 4). Every block above
# -- the `lit_*` one included -- holds the host token NON-NUMERIC, so none of

# fixed-frame finding generalizes: ask what a corpus holds CONSTANT.
#
# Two dimensions, because the pre-parse rewrite is gated on both.
#
#   token   whether a token is an ADDRESS at all is where the two normalizers
#           disagree. WHATWG reads an empty hex digit string as 0 (`0x` -> 0),
#           strips one trailing dot and accepts an uppercase `0X`; the web
#           route's does none of the three, so `0x.0x.0`, `1.2.3.4.` and `0Xff`
#           are registered NAMES to it. `example.com` is the negative control.
