#
# Local stand-in for the GitLab runner (RURL-psqmlgjf).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `.gitlab-ci.yml` is paused: the free-tier compute allowance
# ran out mid-slice and every pipeline after it failed for a reason that had
# nothing to do with the code. That left the pre-push hook as the only gate --
# which is the exact situation the CI config's own header calls out as
# insufficient, and for two reasons that are still true with the runner off:
#
#   1. A HOOK IS OPT-IN PER CLONE. `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`
#      is a thing a person does, not a property of the repository, so "the
#      history is green" states nothing about whether anything checked it.
#   2. A HOOK VERIFIES THE BRANCH TIP, NOT WHAT LANDS. Merges happen on the
#      forge. A squash-merge produces a commit that has never existed on any
#      machine, and the pipeline that used to check it was the one on `main`.
#
# So this is not a second copy of `tools/verify.R` -- the hook already runs that
# against the working tree, on this machine, in the ambient library. This runs
# the CI JOBS: the same image, the same dependency install, against a CLEAN
# CLONE OF A COMMIT rather than a working tree. That difference is where the
# environment-shaped defects live, and they are not hypothetical here: a missing
# Suggests, a `Collate:` that only a real build reads, an `install.packages()`
# that reports failure as a warning and exits 0. None of them are visible to a
# green suite in a developer's fully-populated library.
#
# WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER, so a green run is not read as more than it is:
# it is one machine, one architecture, one R. The cross-platform matrix, rhub,
# coverage and the README re-render run nowhere: their GitHub workflows were
# deleted (RURL-vunvxusf), and the determinism matrix survives only as the
# record under `tools/determinism/gha/` (pkgdown now publishes from the
# `pages` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, release-time only). And it is pull-based --
# nothing makes it run, so it carries the same "someone has to do it"
# weakness as the hook. It narrows the gap the paused runner opened; it does
# not close it.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/local-ci.sh                 # jobs for HEAD, as GitLab would pick them
#   tools/local-ci.sh main            # ... for a named branch, tag or SHA
#   tools/local-ci.sh --list [ref]    # print the plan and exit, run nothing
#   tools/local-ci.sh --all [ref]     # every job, ignoring `rules:`
#   tools/local-ci.sh --keep [ref]    # keep the work tree even on success
#
# AFTER A MERGE, run it against what actually landed:
#   git fetch origin main && tools/local-ci.sh --all origin/main
#
# `--all` IS LOAD-BEARING THERE, not belt-and-braces. The `check` job's rules
# select a tag or a hand-started pipeline and nothing else, so honoring them on
# `main` would run the cheap half and silently skip the `R CMD check --as-cran`
# that is the whole reason to look at a merge commit. Those rules exist to
# ration billed minutes on the forge; locally the minutes are free, so the
# rationing is exactly what you want to override.

# A CLONE, NOT A WORKTREE, and not the checkout you are sitting in. Three
# reasons, each of which has a matching defect class:
#   * untracked and ignored files (`_scratch/`, a stray fixture) are invisible
#     to the forge but visible to every gate that scans the tree;
#   * `git worktree` writes `.git` as a FILE, and `tools/verify.R` requires a
#     `.git` DIRECTORY -- it would refuse to start;
#   * a clone keeps `origin/main`, which is what verify.R diffs against to
#     select gate self-tests. This matters for the `check` job only: its apt
#     line transitively installs git, while the gates job's does not, so the
#     gates job cannot diff at all and runs every self-test. That asymmetry is
#     real CI behavior, not an artifact of running locally -- reproducing it is
#     the point.
