# Dependency-resolvability gate: one script, seven repos.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The seven packages in this family depend on each other, and
# every one of them declares those dependencies twice -- once as a version floor
# in `Imports:`, and again, implicitly, as the set of `dep::symbol` call sites in
# `R/` and `tests/`. Nothing checked that either declaration described a package
# that a stranger could actually install. The failure mode is not theoretical and
# not uniform: measured 2026-08-12 across the seven trees, FOUR repos fail this
# gate on FOUR different defects, and each one is invisible to a fully-populated
# local library because the local library holds development trees.
#
#   rurl       tests/ calls `punycoder::unicode_versions()`, which is exported by
#              punycoder's HEAD and by NO released version -- not CRAN 1.2.1, not
#              tag v1.2.1, not tag v1.2.0 (RURL-ovgasmea). `devtools::test()` is
#              green because the local punycoder IS the development tree.
#   pslr       `Remotes: gitlab::bart-turczynski/punycoder` names no ref, so the
#              tree builds against whatever punycoder HEAD happens to be that day.
#   pagerankr  floors `rurl (>= 3.0.0)`, a version that exists nowhere -- not on
#              CRAN (1.2.0), not as a git tag. And it carries a `Remotes:` field
#              while declaring a RELEASE version (0.1.0), which is the one state
#              in which CRAN rejects the field outright.
#   sitemapr   pins its `Remotes:` at `bart-turczynski/rurl@v2.2.1` with no host
#              prefix, which resolves to GitHub -- the suspended account. Pinned,
#              precise, and unreachable.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM `R CMD check`. `R CMD check` verifies the
# package against THE LIBRARY ON THIS MACHINE. Every defect above survives it,
# because every one of them is a disagreement between what DESCRIPTION promises
# and what the wider world can serve. This gate never reads the local library.
# It reads released artifacts: CRAN tarballs and sibling git tags.
#
# THE FIVE PROPERTIES
#   P1  every floor in `Depends:`/`Imports:` is SATISFIABLE by a version that
#       exists -- on CRAN, or as a git tag in the sibling repo;
#   P2  every `dep::symbol` in `R/` is exported by that dependency at the
#       resolution artifact, read from the RELEASED NAMESPACE;
#   P3  every `dep::symbol` in `tests/` satisfies P2 or sits behind a skip guard;
#   P4  no `Remotes:` on a release tree; on a development tree every entry is
#       pinned to a ref, and that ref resolves -- see WHY A SHA PIN NEEDS ITS
#       OWN RESOLUTION PATH below;
#   P5  unresolvable inputs ABORT rather than score zero findings.
#
# WHY P1 IS SATISFIABILITY AND NOT EXISTENCE. The tempting rule -- "the floor
# names a version that was released" -- produces a false positive on the very
# first case it meets. rurl floors `punycoder (>= 1.2.0)`; punycoder 1.2.0 was
# never on CRAN (the index goes 1.1.0 then 1.2.1), yet the floor is perfectly
# satisfiable by 1.2.1 and a CRAN user installs without noticing. A floor is a
# lower bound, so the question it answers is whether the bound admits anything,
# not whether the bound is itself a shipped artifact. The version-never-released
# fact is still reported, as a note rather than a finding.
#
# WHY P2 CHECKS TWO ARTIFACTS, NOT ONE. A floor promises the package works at
# the floor; CRAN delivers the current release. Those are different tarballs and
# a symbol can be missing from either. `punycoder (>= 1.2.0)` resolves to tag
# v1.2.0 for the floor and to CRAN 1.2.1 for the current release, and
# `unicode_versions` is absent from both -- but a package that used a symbol
# added in 1.2.1 would pass a current-release check and fail its own floor. Both
# are checked, and the message names which artifact was consulted.
#
# WHY A SHA PIN NEEDS ITS OWN RESOLUTION PATH. `git ls-remote` lists REFS. A
# commit sha is not a ref, so asking for one comes back empty and the naive
# check -- `ls-remote --exit-code <url> <sha>` -- calls a perfectly good pin "not
# served". Measured 2026-08-12 against GitLab: exit 2 for `ec2643c`, which was
# punycoder main's own tip at the time. The damage is not the wrong message, it
# is the remedy the wrong message implies: the only pins that satisfy the naive
# check are branch and tag names, and a branch pin is exactly the drift P4
# exists to catch. So a sha-shaped ref gets two further attempts -- a prefix scan
# over the advertised object ids, which resolves a pin sitting at some ref's tip,
# then a shallow `git fetch` of the object itself, which GitLab serves for any
# reachable commit. Both were measured, including the negative: a fabricated sha
# fails the fetch. One case stays genuinely unresolvable and is reported as
# itself rather than as "not served" -- an ABBREVIATED sha that is not at a ref
# tip, because the wire protocol wants a full object id and a shallow fetch of
# `ec2643c` fails where the 40-character form succeeds.
#
# WHY IT PARSES AND DOES NOT GREP. Written first as a grep, this gate reported
# `punycoder::unicode_versions` as a RUNTIME call in `R/format.R`. It is a
# mention in a comment. A regex cannot tell a call site from prose about a call
# site, and this codebase deliberately writes prose about its dependencies. Call
# sites therefore come from `parse()` and a walk of the resulting expressions:
# comments never reach the parse tree, and a package name inside a string
# literal is not a `::` call. Same instrument as checks C3/C4 of the
# zero-reference gate next door, for the same reason.
#
# NON-VACUITY (P5). A gate that scores zero findings because it found no
# population passes for the wrong reason, which is the worst outcome available
# to it. Each of these aborts instead: a DESCRIPTION that will not parse; a
# dependency whose version universe comes back empty; a downloaded artifact that
# is not a gzip archive (a CRAN 404 serves an HTML body with status 200 to a
# careless fetch -- this gate hit exactly that and cached a 992-byte error page
# as a tarball); a NAMESPACE with no exports; and, before anything else, a
# reachability probe -- if the network is down, every remote is "unreachable"
# and the gate would report a page of confident nonsense.
#
# NETWORK. This gate is deliberately NOT network-free, unlike the other gates in
# `tools/`. Its whole subject is what the outside world serves, so a cached
# transcript would answer a question about the past. Artifacts are cached under
# `$RURL_DEPGATE_CACHE` (default `~/.cache/rurl-dep-gate`) so repeat runs are
# cheap, and `--offline` scores from the cache alone and aborts on a miss rather
# than guessing. It is a release-readiness gate, not a per-push gate.

# BINDING it and then looking the binding up is not: `part <- e[[i]]` succeeds
# and the very next mention of `part`, including `is.null(part)`, raises
# `argument "part" is missing, with no default`. `tryCatch` around the subscript
# does not help, because the subscript was never what failed. So the loops below
# test and recurse on `e[[i]]` directly and never assign it to a name;

# is exactly the guard needed. Written the natural way, this gate aborted on the
