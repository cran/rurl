#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

# Local verify gate (RURL-mvsxmyww).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every gate this repository owns ran in exactly one place --
# GitHub Actions -- so when pushing stopped, verification stopped with it. The
# cost was not hypothetical: an integration branch accumulated 61 commits during
# the outage, and by the time anyone looked, the package DID NOT BUILD (two
# files missing from `Collate:`), a test ERRORED under `R CMD check`, and FOUR
# gates were red, one of them for days. `devtools::test()` was green throughout.
# That is the whole point: a green test suite is not a green package, and the
# only instrument that knows the difference is a real build plus check.
#
# THE GATE LIST IS DERIVED, NOT TRANSCRIBED. The gate steps below are read out
# of tools/verify-manifest.yml at run time. A hand-maintained copy would be
# one more list to forget: add a gate to the manifest, and a local mirror that
# repeats it by hand is silently incomplete from that moment. Reading the
# manifest means a new gate is picked up here the day it lands, and a gate
# REMOVED from it stops running here too. It also means this script cannot
# claim to mirror the manifest while quietly running something else.
#
# The manifest was `.github/workflows/verify.yml` until RURL-vunvxusf moved it
# under tools/ and deleted the dead GitHub workflows around it. It keeps the
# GitHub-Actions `jobs:`/`steps:` shape because that shape is what this
# parser reads and what carries each gate's rationale; no forge executes it.
# `.gitlab-ci.yml` runs this script, so GitLab consumes the same manifest.
#
# GATE SELF-TESTS ARE A SEPARATE RISK CLASS. Their positive/negative fixtures
# prove the verifier, not the product, so routine runs select them only when the
# corresponding script changed relative to main. `--release` deliberately runs
# every self-test. The real tree scans still run in every complete local gate.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated so nobody reads a green run as more than it is:
#   * cross-platform and multi-R-version checks -- this runs one platform,
#     one R, and the GitHub matrix workflows that used to cover the rest
#     (full-check, rhub) are deleted, so nothing does;
#   * README.md re-render (the manifest's `readme` job), coverage, the OSV
#     and security audits, news-version, and the determinism matrix (pkgdown
#     is the release-time `pages` job in .gitlab-ci.yml) -- all need
#     network, a pandoc/LaTeX toolchain, or a Docker matrix;
#   * the C7 curl clean room, which needs its own R CMD check against a poisoned
#     library. `--release` adds it; the default does not, because it doubles the
#     slowest stage to re-prove a criterion that only matters at release.
#
# It is not a strict subset of the manifest in either direction, so neither
# "green here means green there" nor its converse holds. The check stage runs
# `--as-cran`, which is STRICTER than the manifest's `check` job (that one
# passes `--no-manual` alone and left `--as-cran` to the deleted full-check
# workflow), so this can fail where that job would have passed. A pass here
# means "the fast gate's checks hold on this machine" -- not "the release is
# ready", and not "CI will be green".
#
# STAGE ORDER is cheapest-first, so a broken tree fails in seconds rather than
# after a five-minute check. Stages are independent: a failure does not stop the
# run, because knowing all of what is broken beats knowing the first thing.
#
# WARNING-ONLY SIGNALS (RURL-pbihchti). A step's output is printed only when it
# FAILS, so anything real that does not change an exit status is structurally
# invisible here -- across a full run that is every passing step. The rationale
# for the quiet default is sound and is NOT reverted: a gate that dumps 40 lines
# per passing step is a gate whose real failures scroll past. What was missing
# is an escape hatch, plus a default-on instrument for the one place we know
# carries such signal.
#
# `--verbose` prints every step's log in full regardless of status. In FULL, not
# as the 25-line failure tail: RURL-aajradge's testthat WARN was ever visible
# only because it happened to fall inside those 25 lines while an unrelated
# defect made the same step FAIL. That is luck twice over, and a tail that can
# truncate the block you came for is not an escape hatch.
#
# `watch =` is the default-on half. A step may declare a regex; on a PASS whose
# log matches it, the matched block prints under a `!` marker. Quiet when there
# is nothing to say, loud exactly when there is -- so the known-hazardous step
# is honest by default rather than opt-in, and opt-in is precisely how
# `aajradge` stayed hidden. The check stage has done this ad hoc for WARNING and
# NOTE lines since it was written; `watch` is that idea, named and reusable.
#
# Usage:
#   Rscript tools/verify.R            # gates + relevant self-tests + full gate
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --gates    # gates + relevant self-tests ONLY
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --fast     # the above plus lint
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --release  # everything, plus the curl clean room
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --verbose  # print every step's log, passing included
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --list     # print the stage plan and exit
#   Rscript tools/verify.R --self-test  # prove the two instruments above
# `--fast` is iteration feedback only. It is never sufficient verification for
# a behavioral slice; the unsuffixed command remains the end-of-slice gate.
#
# `--gates` exists for CI on a compute-minutes budget: the gate family needs
# almost no installed packages and runs in about a minute, where the check stage
# needs the full toolchain and every dependency. It lets a pipeline run the
# cheap half on every push and the whole thing on the default branch WITHOUT
# hand-listing the gates in a CI config -- which is the drift this script exists
# to prevent (see "THE GATE LIST IS DERIVED, NOT TRANSCRIBED" above). Like
# `--fast`, it is not sufficient verification for a behavioral slice.
#
# Base R only. Exits 1 if any BLOCKING stage fails.

# There is no longer an advisory stage. The control-plane gate used to be one:
# it went red whenever a contract body was edited under an ACCEPTED acceptance
# gate, and clearing it needed an owner seal-merge rather than a code change, so
# wiring it as blocking would have failed every unrelated commit and trained
# people to pass `--no-verify`.
#
# ADR 0014 removed the cause instead of tolerating the symptom: the hash cascade
# and the seal are gone, and what survives of validate-records.R is structural
# and clearable by fixing the tree. It is wired into the manifest as an
# ordinary blocking gate, so it arrives here through the derived list like any
# other.
