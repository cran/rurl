# External adversarial/conformance URL vectors imported from third-party suites
# (RURL-dbazixkr, epic RURL-wncwfasl — the R Journal paper's disagreement
# table). Unlike the hand-derived golden table in
# test-url-standard-conformance.R, these rows are transcribed from external
# sources and their oracle is the
# SOURCE's expectation, recorded per row in `standard` + `standard_expectation`
# (and, for class-C paper rows, `paper_claimed_behavior` kept SEPARATE from the
# standard's "should"). The fixture doubles as the results table: it records
# rurl's actual output in both profiles and a `diverges` flag vs the row oracle.
#
# Slice 1 seeds it with the WHATWG web-platform-tests `url/resources/
# urltestdata.json` FAILURE cases (BSD-3-Clause) — inputs the WHATWG URL parser
# MUST reject. rurl rejects all but a small, pinned set where its WHATWG profile
# still accepts (forbidden host code points surfaced as `warning-no-tld`). These
# are NOT declared correct-forever: each is triaged in the divergence ledger
# (_scratch/divergence-ledger.md) as documented-boundary vs candidate-bug — some
# (e.g. the UTS-46 soft-hyphen rows) are open bug candidates, not settled
# behavior. This test is a characterization/regression guard: it pins rurl's
# recorded output and the divergence set so BOTH a regression (a new must-fail
# input starts being accepted) AND progress (a tracked divergence gets fixed)
# force a deliberate, reviewed update here.
#
# Part 3a (RURL-moselrwp) adds a DUAL-STANDARD expected-outcome oracle:
# `rfc3986_expected` + `whatwg_expected` record what each STANDARD requires
# (clean_url / "failure" / "accept" sentinel), `oracle_ref` cites the RFC 3986
# section(s) / WHATWG algorithm step(s) it is derived from, and
# `divergence_class` buckets each row (aligned / spec-divergent / both-accept /
# both-reject / not-runnable). This is orthogonal to
# `diverges` (which flags rurl vs the row's SOURCE oracle): `divergence_class`
# is standard-vs-standard.
#
# RURL-nknytzxz then split the one thing this schema still conflated. The
# `rfc3986_expected` cells were transcribed from WPT -- a WHATWG oracle -- so
# on 75 rows they asserted "RFC 3986 rejects this" about strings the RFC
# plainly accepts (empty reg-name, pct-encoded reg-name octets, path-rootless
# read as userinfo), and on 20 more they recorded rurl's tolerant OUTPUT as if
# the RFC mandated it. Because rurl ALSO declines the first 75 -- by policy,
# not by standard -- oracle and implementation confirmed each other and the
# suite stayed green. The repair: `divergence_class` is now purely
# standard-vs-standard (the old `parser-boundary` value, which described rurl,
# is retired), a new `rurl_deviation` column carries "rurl departs here, and
# this ADR/ticket owns the decision", and the `oracle-vs-grammar` test below
# checks the RFC column against a transcription of the RFC's own ABNF so the
# co-confirmation trap cannot reopen. Derivation:
# tools/oracle-audit-rfc3986.R.
# The `aligned` bucket is deliberately un-cited (tiered): where RFC, WHATWG, and
# rurl (both profiles) all agree, a self-consistency invariant stands in for a
# hand-derived oracle, so citation effort concentrates on the diverging rows.

fixture_path <- testthat::test_path("fixtures", "external-url-vectors.csv")

# The adversarial `input` column cannot survive a round-trip through a raw CSV
# cell on every platform: two rows embed raw CR/LF and 13 more carry C0 control
# characters, so a non-UTF-8 locale (Windows) mis-decodes them and even a
# UTF-8 read silently normalizes CRLF -> LF inside quoted fields. The fixture
# therefore carries an ASCII-only, JSON-escaped `input_json` column as the
# SOURCE OF TRUTH; `input` is the human-readable mirror. Reconstruct `input`
# from it -- but ONLY for runnable rows: non-runnable rows are provenance-only
# and must keep `input` NA (invariant asserted above).
#
# THE FIXTURE IS READ FROM MEMORY, NOT THROUGH A CONNECTION, and that is
# load-bearing (RURL-gxgxyzpk). CRAN's 3.0.0 incoming pretest failed on
# r-devel-windows-x86_64 ONLY -- six failures, every one of them a whole-corpus
# shape invariant, while every expectation that FILTERS the corpus passed. That
# split has one cause: a row parsed one field out of register, so non-NA garbage
# landed in `source_class`, `standard`, `divergence_class`, `runnable` and
# `rurl_deviation`. Truncation is excluded twice over -- it yields NAs
# (`anyNA(divergence_class)` passed) and warns `EOF within quoted string` (CRAN
# reported WARN 0).
#
# 3.0.1 pinned `LC_CTYPE` to "C", on the theory that `scan()`'s `mbrtowc()` path
# mangled the fixture's astral-plane and noncharacter sequences. That theory is
# wrong and the pin is gone. Two win-builder probes measured it on Windows: the
# pin TAKES -- `l10n_info()` goes MBCS TRUE -> FALSE, codepage 65001 -> 0 -- and
# changes nothing. The corpus still read 389 rows where the bytes describe 396.
#
# The fault is R's TEXT-MODE FILE CONNECTION on Windows. In one process at one
# locale, the same bytes give 389 records through `file()` and 396 read from
# memory. `readLines(file(fx, "r"))` returns 405 lines / 276576 bytes against
# `readBin()`'s 413 lines / 280019 bytes, and the first byte at which the two
# diverge is offset 45710, which holds the file's single 0x1A (SUB). It is not
# a plain truncation there -- the connection resynchronizes and returns most of
# the rest of the file, 3443 bytes and 8 lines short -- but that byte is where
# the text path stops tracking the file's contents, and everything after it is
# read out of register.
#
# So: read the bytes with `readBin()`, mark them UTF-8, and hand the string to
# `read.csv(text = )`. That is not a workaround; it is the only reader that
# cannot meet a text-mode connection, because it opens no connection. UTF-8 is
# ASCII-transparent -- no multibyte sequence contains a `,` or `"` byte -- so a
# bytewise CSV parse of a UTF-8 file is exact, and exact identically on every
# platform. `encoding = "UTF-8"` still marks the results, so the parse is
# `identical()` to the connection-based one, encoding marks included, wherever
# that one was already right.

  # Curated headline divergences from Ajmani et al. (SecWeb'22), Section V/VI
  # (class C; bytes verified against wspr-ncsu/urlparsing-framework, BSD-3). The
  # oracle is the paper's `whatwg-url` reference column. rurl reproduces both
  # sides of the SOP equivocation across profiles and agrees with the WHATWG
  # reference on the plain hostname-confusion rows; it diverged on 3, each
  # triaged in the divergence ledger, and none is left:
  # yal-009 `www.php.net:80/...` NO LONGER diverges: WHATWG's scheme state reads
  #   a dotted `www.php.net` as the SCHEME (dots are legal scheme code points)
  #   with an opaque path, and the `whatwg` profile now does too. The
  #   scheme-less host:port carve-out in `.general_parsed_mask()` is off under
  #   `scheme_policy = "require"` (RURL-lxdwuacn, RUL-014); the filed deviation
  #   (RURL-yeikpnan) and its `rurl_deviation` accounting were re-baselined in
  #   that slice. `scheme_policy = "infer"` still reads host:port (ADR 0010).
  # yal-005 (non-ASCII host) and yal-008 (`foo://`) NO LONGER diverge: both were
  # surface artifacts (RURL-yeikpnan). Surface (c) keeps the host reversibly
  # Unicode by ADR 0002 and declines `foo:` by the ADR 0004 closed scheme set;
  # the standard serializer emits the punycode host and accepts the non-special
  # scheme, which is what the paper's WHATWG reference does.
  # yal-002/003 (control chars in the authority) NO LONGER diverge: the whatwg
  # profile now strips ASCII tab/CR/LF before parsing (RURL-tyetpjym), matching
  # WHATWG, and surfaces the mutation via the `control-char-stripped` diagnostic
  # (asserted below). rfc3986 still rejects them (RFC has no strip step).
