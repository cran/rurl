# G4 criterion-3 negative coverage.
#
# The six-family coverage audit found a systematic asymmetry: behavior that
# ships correctly and is exercised on the happy path, but whose NEGATIVE
# polarity is unasserted. G4 criterion 3 requires both polarities, so a cell
# with only positive coverage is a gap, not a pass.
#
# Every assertion here pins behavior that ALREADY holds -- these tests were
# green the first time they ran. None of them encodes a wished-for behavior:
# cells whose correct behavior was still undecided when this file was written
# (the general-branch credential loss, the authority route disagreement,
# list-input recovery, input-name handling) are deliberately absent, because
# writing a test for an undecided cell would freeze an arbitrary answer as if
# it were the contract. Those carry their own fp carriers; two have since been
# decided and pinned by those carriers (credentials in test-url-standard-
# authority.R, authority state in test-p1-2-authority-state.R).

# ---- mutation: invalid dial values are rejected -----------------------------

# The audit found ZERO tests asserting an invalid enum value for any of the 11
# legacy presentation dials, while query_handling, port_handling, scheme_policy,
# scheme_acceptance, url_standard, profile and engine all had one. The dials are
# validated through match.arg() in .parse_options(); nothing pinned it.
#
# The expectation matches only "should be one of" and NEVER the quoted
# alternatives: R renders those with directional quotes under a UTF-8 locale and
# straight quotes under LC_ALL=C, and the suite runs under both (the
# `Tests (LC_ALL=C)` CI job). Matching the quotes would make this cell pass on
# one runner and fail on the other.
