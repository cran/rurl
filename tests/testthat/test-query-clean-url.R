# T2 (RURL-mzbnubrx): the query-filter engine wired into safe_parse_url() /
# safe_parse_urls() -> clean_url, option validation in .parse_options(), the
# case_handling exemption, cache correctness across query profiles, and the
# canonical_join() consequence. The engine internals themselves are pinned in
# test-query-engine.R (T1); this file exercises the PUBLIC surface.
