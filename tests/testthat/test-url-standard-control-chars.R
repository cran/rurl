# Tests for the WHATWG control-character stripping vertical slice
# (RURL-tyetpjym, epic RURL-moselrwp). The WHATWG basic URL parser's first step
# removes every ASCII tab (U+0009), LF (U+000A), and CR (U+000D) from the input
# before parsing. rurl otherwise rejects a control char in the authority
# (the parser errors) -- correct under RFC 3986, which requires such bytes to
# be
# percent-encoded and has no strip step. So the strip runs ONLY under
# url_standard = "whatwg"; rfc3986 and no selector keep rejecting. Stripping is
# surfaced, not silent: it fires the `control-char-stripped` diagnostic
# (ADR 0006). Built via paste0() so the exact control byte is unambiguous.

TAB <- "\t"; LF <- "\n"; CR <- "\r"
