#
# A small, inspectable set of path/query/userinfo cases with EXPLICIT expected
# outputs (unlike the whole-corpus characterization snapshot, which pins
# whatever the code currently emits). It documents rurl's intended contract for
# percent-encoding and path structure and pins it against engine drift.
#
# rurl's default profile is an RFC 3986 parser, NOT a WHATWG URL parser. Cases
# drawn from
# the WHATWG URL test data where rurl *intentionally* diverges (encoded-dot
# resolution, backslash-as-separator) are kept and annotated, so a future
# accidental behavior change is caught rather than silently "conforming".
