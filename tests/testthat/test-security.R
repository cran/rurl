# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::audit_description()` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and audits
# rurl's hard dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It is a network
# test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER / OSSINDEX_TOKEN):
# the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401. Every reported
# advisory must have a disposition in helper-security.R; that file states the
# three rules this test enforces.
#
# Scope: hard dependencies only -- `Depends` + `Imports`, never `Suggests`.
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Depends` + `Imports` + `Suggests`, and
# `Suggests` drags in the recursive dependency trees of the dev tooling --
# including oysteR's own, which reaches an HTTP transfer library through httr.
# So the gate was failing on a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in
# anything a user of this package installs.
#
# Measured 2026-09-10, same machine and credentials: the Suggests-inclusive
# scope audits 89 packages here and reports one of them vulnerable, while
# `Depends` + `Imports` audits 9 and reports none -- the flagged package is
# absent from rurl's hard dependency tree entirely. RURL-mafkcwnu carries the
# advisory identifiers and the measurement. Re-measured 2026-09-24: `Depends` +
# `Imports` audits 10 packages and reports none.
#
# A package's security posture is what it makes users install, so the audit
# calls `audit_description()` directly with the narrower `fields`.
# `expect_secure()` sets a CRAN mirror internally and `audit_description()`
# does not, hence the explicit `repos` option.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY THE PRECONDITIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS SKIPS.
#
# Everywhere ordinary -- a local `testthat::test_local()`, a plain
# `R CMD check --as-cran` -- a missing precondition is a skip. That is right:
# a developer without OSS Index credentials is not a security regression.
#
# In a job that exists to run this audit, it is not right: a job without
# credentials would skip, report success, and have audited nothing -- the
# failure `PUNY-rsxtbbln` records in punycoder. A green job that audited
# nothing is worse than no job, because it answers a question it was never
# asked. So under OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true every precondition below becomes
# a hard failure with a message naming what is missing.
#
# rurl has NO such job today. The GitHub workflow that used to run this audit
# (security-audit.yml) was deleted with RURL-vunvxusf, and `.gitlab-ci.yml`
# carries no replacement, so nothing sets the flag.
#
# NOT IN THE PRE-PUSH GATE. `tools/verify.R`'s LC_ALL=C cell runs
# `testthat::test_local()`, which sets NOT_CRAN=true, so `skip_on_cran()` does
# not fire there -- and `~/.Renviron` puts the credentials in scope inside R.
# This audit therefore ran live on every push, and a new upstream advisory
# blocked an unrelated push on 2026-09-09. That cell now excludes this file and
# test-osv.R (SEOR-fftbjnpl). `R CMD check` leaves NOT_CRAN unset, so the check
# stage skips it too. The consequence, stated plainly: NOTHING runs this audit
# automatically. Run it deliberately with
# `testthat::test_local(filter = "security")`; add
# `OSSINDEX_AUDIT_REQUIRED=true` to make a missing precondition fail.
