# Tests for resolve_url() (RURL-wrfcildb, epic RURL-ehlircjt / parent
# RURL-uyjheruh; PRD v2 §5.6 D6). resolve_url() composes: an RFC 3986 §5.2.2
# base-merge, then the same safe_parse_urls() machinery for host/path/port/query
# normalization and diagnostics.
#
# TWO CLAIMS IN THE ORIGINAL HEADER ARE RETIRED, and both are load-bearing for
# reading the assertions below:
#
#   * "standard-agnostic ... adds NO per-standard behavior of its own" --
#     FALSIFIED by measurement (P2.7 D-B, RURL-fupsemxr). Under
#     `url_standard = "whatwg"` the WHATWG reference-PARSING rules run before
#     the merge; under "rfc3986" it is RFC 3986 section 5.2-5.3; under NULL it
#     is byte-frozen (ADR 0007). The scheme production is RFC 3986 section 3.1's
#     and ships under both named profiles. See the P2.7 D-B block below.
#   * "The return is the CANONICAL clean_url" -- true only of the DEFAULT
#     `output = "clean"`. `output = "serialized"` (P2.7 D-A) returns
#     serialize_url()'s full standard string, fragment and credentials intact,
#     and requires an explicit `url_standard`.
#
# The default-output caveat still stands as written: clean_url drops
# fragment/userinfo and applies query_handling/port_handling, which is why
# several RFC section 5.4 expectations below differ from a verbatim resolver on
# the query/fragment components only.
