# --- host_encoding = "unicode" preserves the label structure ----------------
# RURL-eikgtrqf. `unicode` is a RENDERING knob over a host identity, so it may
# change a label's SPELLING (A-label -> U-label) but never how many labels the
# host has. The decode seam used to rejoin `strsplit(host, ".", fixed = TRUE)`,
# which drops trailing empty labels (ADR 0005 documents that base-R gap), so a
# root-dot FQDN silently lost its root label and converged on the non-FQDN host
# that P3.2 (KJ-O1..O8) holds DISTINCT. The WHATWG host parser does not strip a
# root dot either, so `unicode` was also the only rendering diverging from the
# standard it sits under.
