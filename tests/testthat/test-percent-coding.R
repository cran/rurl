# `.pct_escape()` / `.pct_unescape()` replaced `curl::curl_escape()` /
# `curl::curl_unescape()`. Every expectation below is written as a LITERAL, not
# as a differential against curl: the point of the swap is that curl leaves the
# package entirely (RURL-cunfohwy forbids a curl reference in tests too), so the
# oracle has to be the standard and the recorded libcurl behavior, not a live
# call.
#
# Parity was established before the swap by a differential sweep of 4,608
# inputs -- every octet 0x01-0xFF standalone, every `%XX` triplet in both hex
# cases bare and embedded, the malformed-`%` family, multibyte UTF-8, and 4,000
# random mixes -- comparing VALUES, RAW BYTES and `Encoding()` marks, in both
# directions and round-tripped: 0 differences.
#
# All non-ASCII literals are \u escapes so the file parses identically in any
# locale (same reason as test-locale-invariance.R).
