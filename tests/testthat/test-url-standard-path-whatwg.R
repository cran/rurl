# WHATWG path profile: preserve unreserved + encoded-dot recognizer
# (RURL-bbmuehsx, epic RURL-eqzkkohm; PRD §6.1). Under
# `url_standard = "whatwg"` rurl NEVER decodes percent-encoded bytes (reserved
# or unreserved), preserves percent-triplet spelling, and resolves dot segments
# via an encoded-dot recognizer that treats "."/"%2e"/"%2E" (and their
# double-dot combinations) as dot segments without a general path decode.
