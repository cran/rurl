# Locale invariance of rurl's output (RURL-izzuenjx).
#
# The contract these tests lock in, stated plainly:
#
#   1. rurl's output does not depend on `LC_CTYPE`. The same input yields the
#      same VALUES and the same `Encoding()` marks under `LC_ALL=C` and under a
#      UTF-8 locale. The cross-locale half of that is enforced by CI: the
#      `Tests (LC_ALL=C)` cell in tools/verify-manifest.yml runs this whole
#      suite under a genuinely non-UTF-8 LC_CTYPE. What THIS file asserts is
#      the in-process half -- the marks and the bytes -- which is what makes
#      the two runs agree.
#   2. Every returned character component carries `Encoding() == "UTF-8"` when
#      it holds non-ASCII. R never marks a pure-ASCII string, so an ASCII
#      component correctly reports "unknown"; that is asserted too, so a future
#      reader does not "fix" it into a bug.
#   3. `enc2utf8()` and `iconv()`-from-native must not reappear in the parse
#      path. Both transcode FROM THE SESSION LOCALE, which is precisely the
#      defect the marks replaced (`Encoding<-` declares, it never converts).
#
# Every assertion here would fail if one of the six fixes that established the
# contract were reverted (e9defab, c6a0457, b26a334, 62a24a9, d7181a1, 0a339ce).
#
# All non-ASCII literals below are written as \u escapes on purpose: an escape
# parses to a UTF-8-marked string in ANY locale, so these tests cannot
# themselves become the locale-dependent thing they are testing.

# --- 4c. The same defect where the mask is a CONJUNCTION ---------------------
#
# The first pass at RURL-kmpnbvdl closed the authority `@` split and stopped
# there, because the corpus that found the defect varied ONE octet at a time.
# Every mask past that split is a conjunction: reaching it needs the bad octet
# AND a second character that makes the row eligible -- a sub-delim, a
# percent-triplet, a repeated "@". A one-octet-at-a-time corpus cannot build a
# pair, so it scored the partial fix as complete. These are the shapes that
# still threw afterwards, one per surviving site:
#
#   the host-charset shim's reassembly            -- stri_length() on the
#     authority, reached only on a `restore` row (bad octet + charset mask).
#     That shim was `.shim_whatwg_host_charset_vec()`; RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 1
#     moved literal host acceptance into the parser (`host_charset`, ADR 0013),
#     which judges the raw byte vector and so has no reassembly to mis-slice.
#     The row below still pins the conjunction, for the same reason as the
#     repeated-"@" one: the site moved, the input class did not.
#   `.pct_hex_upper()`                            -- gsub(perl = TRUE).
#   the repeated-"@" repair                       -- gsub(fixed = TRUE). That
#     repair was `.encode_excess_authority_at_vec()` when this was written;
#     RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 3 moved the last-"@" split into the parser
#     (`.web_encode_at()`), which works on the byte vector and so cannot
#     reach a locale-sensitive `gsub` at all. The row below still pins the
#     conjunction, and must: the site moved, the input class did not.
#
# Note `<C3><28>` needs no added sub-delim: "(" IS one, so the invalid pair is

# --- 4e. The one warning the LC_ALL=C cell tolerated (RURL-aajradge) ---------
#
# `strings not representable in native encoding will be translated to UTF-8`,
# reported against whichever test first touches pslr in a full run
# (test-accessor-helper.R:6). The emitter is UPSTREAM and it is not a
# function: it is R's lazy-load of pslr's `R/sysdata.rdb`. Released pslr
# 1.1.1 serialized the bundled index's IDN suffixes with a native mark from a
# UTF-8 build session, so a C-locale reader translates them on first fetch and
# warns once per session. Forcing `pslr:::pslr_bundled` with no pslr code
# running reproduces it; no rurl frame is involved at all. pslr 1.1.1.9000
# stores those strings UTF-8-marked and is silent (PSLR-jzdhhugc).
#
# Two measurement facts that shape the assertion:
#
#   - It is not a Linux-only defect. Released pslr 1.1.1 warns on macOS under
#     `LC_ALL=C` too; a local run is silent only because the local library
#     holds the dev pslr. The axis is the pslr version, not the OS.
#   - The promise is forced ONCE per session, so no in-process call can reach
#     the emitter after the first test file has touched pslr -- a fresh
#     `pslr::psl_engine()` is silent on released pslr too. The probe therefore
#     runs in a fresh session, and forces the C charset itself, which also
#     makes it live on a UTF-8 developer machine rather than only in the
#     `LC_ALL=C` cell.
#
# Guarded on the DEV version, not the next release: that way it asserts on
# every dev checkout and every later release, and skips -- rather than fails --
# on the released pslr the DESCRIPTION floor still admits, which is the pslr
# the CI cell's "warnings tolerated" note is about.
