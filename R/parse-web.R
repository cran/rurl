# In-tree parser for the WEB/special-scheme route (RURL-robgajml, step 3).
#
# This file replaces the last remaining libcurl seam. Every other route already
# owns its parser in-tree: `.parse_opaque_urls_vec()` (posture opaque/RFC),
# `.parse_rfc_file_urls_vec()` (RFC 8089 overlay) and
# `.parse_whatwg_file_urls_vec()` (WHATWG `file:` state machine). What was left
# was the http/https/ftp/ftps (+ ws/wss under `whatwg`) slice, which Phase 2
# handed to `curl::curl_parse_url(decode = FALSE, params = FALSE)`.
#
# CONTRACT. `.parse_web_url_one()` is a drop-in for that call: it takes ONE
# fully PREPARED URL string (Phase 1 has already fabricated the scheme, stripped
# tab/LF/CR, rewritten backslashes, canonicalized WHATWG IPv4 and applied the
# host-charset shim) and returns either `NULL` (the row is a parse error) or a
# list of components: `url`, `scheme`, `host`,
# `port`, `path`, `query`, `fragment`, `user`, `password`. Absent components are
# `NULL`, exactly as libcurl reported them, so every `%||% NA_character_` and
# `.blank_to_na()` downstream keeps working unchanged.
#
# EIGHT of those nine reproduce libcurl's spelling and were verified to. `url`
# DOES NOT, and never did -- read this before reaching for it:
#
#   input                     libcurl $url             this $url
#   HTTP://example.com/p      http://example.com/p     HTTP://example.com/p
#   http://example.com        http://example.com/      http://example.com
#   http://example.com/a%2fb  http://example.com/a%2Fb http://example.com/a%2fb
#
# libcurl RE-SERIALIZES (ASCII-lowercases the scheme, supplies "/" for an empty
# path, uppercases every %XX); this returns the PREPARED INPUT VERBATIM. Over a
# 53,407-input corpus 10,614 rows (~20%) differ on `url`, against 3 on the eight
# consumed fields. Nothing in rurl reads `url` -- `.extract_raw_components()`
# and the vectorized path take scheme/host/port/path/query/fragment/user/
# password and nothing else -- so the divergence is inert. It stops being inert
# the moment someone treats `url` as a re-serialization; the FSSS
# (`serialize_url()`) is what renders a URL, not this field.
#
# WHY IT REPRODUCES LIBCURL RATHER THAN THE SPEC DIRECTLY. rurl's accept/reject
# verdict at this seam is load-bearing for `parse_status`, and the profile
# corrections that surround it (the ADR 0009 host-charset shim, the WHATWG IPv4
# rewrite, the excess-"@" repair) were all calibrated against libcurl's exact
# behaviour. Swapping the engine and the semantics in one step would make any
# conformance movement unattributable. So step 3 is a BEHAVIOUR-PRESERVING
# engine swap, verified by differential sweep; step 4 then deletes the
# compensation layer and moves the semantics deliberately, scored against the
# FSSS/WPT harness.
#
# STEP 4 IS UNDER WAY, so the list above is already out of date in two places.
# The excess-"@" repair is GONE (deletion 3): splitting the authority at the
# LAST "@" is what the WHATWG authority state does, so it is parser behaviour
# -- see `last_at_userinfo` below. The host-charset shim is gone ENTIRELY, in
# two steps: its percent-triplet half first (deletion 2), because which host
# triplets get decoded is decode ORDER -- see `host_pct` -- and then its literal
# gap-character mask (deletion 1, ADR 0013 superseding ADR 0009), because which
# literal bytes a host may hold is an accept/reject rule -- see `host_charset`.
# The pqf fallback is GONE as well (deletion 5): whether an unwritable byte
# outside the authority is refused or escaped is an accept/reject rule, so it is
# parser behaviour -- see `pqf_bytes`.
#
# Every rule below was derived by MEASUREMENT against
# libcurl (per-octet acceptance sweeps over host/userinfo/path/query/fragment,
# plus targeted probes for IPv4/IPv6/authority/port/dot-segment behaviour), not
# from reading the RFC -- because the thing being reproduced is libcurl, and
# where libcurl departs from the RFC that departure is the fact of record.
#
# The measured model, in one place (see tests/testthat/test-parse-web.R for the
# literal-oracle encoding of every clause):
#
#   scheme    ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." ) ":" -- any scheme is
#             accepted here (the allowed set is gated upstream), and the
#             reported spelling is ASCII-lowercased.
#   slashes   1..3 "/" may follow the scheme; 0 or >=4 is a parse error. Three
#             slashes means an EMPTY authority, and libcurl then promotes the
#             first path segment into the host (`http:///a/b` -> host "a",
#             path "/b") -- the shape `.extract_raw_path_vec()` documents.
#   authority up to the first "/" of what remains (after "#" and "?" are cut).
#             An empty authority is a parse error.
#   userinfo  split from the host at the LAST "@"; every earlier "@" is
#             percent-encoded into the userinfo as "%40". Under
#             `last_at_userinfo = FALSE` (the default, and what libcurl did)
#             only ONE "@" is admitted and a second is a parse error. Either
#             way: split into user/password at the FIRST ":"; bytes restricted
#             to 0x21-0x7E minus "@"; NEVER percent-decoded.
#   host      percent-DECODED first (a "%" not followed by two hex digits is a
#             parse error), then every decoded byte must be in
#             [A-Za-z0-9._~|-]; then libcurl's IPv4 normalization. A bracketed
#             host is an IPv6 literal, validated and re-serialized.
#             This is `host_pct = "decode"` with `host_charset = "narrow"`, the
#             no-selector default. `host_pct` changes how a parsed host is
#             SPELLED BACK and `host_charset` which literal bytes it may hold;
#             both are documented at `.parse_web_url_one()` below.
#   port      ":" then ASCII digits only, value <= 65535, leading zeros
#             stripped; an EMPTY port (":" then end/"/"/"?"/"#") is no port.
#             The 65535 ceiling is `port_range = "u16"`, the default and what
#             libcurl did; the rfc3986 selector asks for `"unbounded"`, since
#             RFC 3986 sec 3.2.3 is `port = *DIGIT`. Documented at
#             `.web_port_range_policy()` below.
#   path      "/" when absent; C0/space/DEL are a parse error; bytes >= 0x80 are
#             percent-encoded; the two characters after every "%" are
#             ASCII-uppercased; then dot segments are removed, INCLUDING
#             percent-encoded ones ("/a/%2E%2E/b" -> "/b").
#             This is `pqf_bytes = "reject"`; under `"encode"` the C0/space/DEL
#             rejection becomes a percent-encoding, documented at

# -- and reconciling them is most of that deletion, because what they disagreed
# about is not how an address is SPELLED but whether a token is an address AT
# ALL. Three forms, and WHATWG reads every one of them as an address where the
# narrow flavour reads a registered name:
#
#   empty hex digits   `0x` is the number 0 to WHATWG (its IPv4-number parser
#                      strips the "0x" and returns 0 for what is left), and the
#                      name "0x" to the narrow flavour
#   trailing dot       WHATWG removes one empty final part before splitting, so
#                      `1.2.3.4.` is the address; narrow keeps it a name
#   uppercase `0X`     WHATWG's prefix test is case-insensitive and narrow's is
#                      not, so `0Xff` is a name and `0xff` the address
#                      0.0.0.255
#
# One function with a flag rather than two functions, so the disagreement is
# stated in one place instead of having to be rediscovered by diffing them. The
# narrow success set is a strict SUBSET of the WHATWG one and the two agree on
# every value in it, which is why the whatwg profile needs no fallback to the
# narrow one.
#
# A token that is not an address is returned UNCHANGED -- it is simply a

# The seam. One prepared URL in; libcurl's field list out, or NULL.
#
# The whole structural scan runs on the BYTE vector and cuts BY POSITION. That
# is not a style choice: the prepared string can be declared UTF-8 while holding
# invalid octets, and `stringi` refuses such input outright (returning NA from
# `stri_match_first_regex`, which would read here as "not a URL" and reject
# every high-byte row libcurl happily parses). Cutting by position also
# sidesteps the ICU line-terminator trap -- `.` not matching VT/FF/NEL/LS/PS,
# and `$`
# matching BEFORE a trailing one -- that this codebase has lost two sessions to.
#
# FOUR policy dials, all here rather than in front of the parser because all
# describe *parsing*, not repair. Each defaults to the historical no-selector
# behaviour, and callers opt in per selected standard.
#
# `last_at_userinfo` -- split the authority at the LAST "@". WHATWG's authority
# state buffers until the final "@" and prepends "%40" for each earlier one. It
# stays a dial because the P2.1 C-03 disposition binds repeated-"@" recovery to
# the `compatibility`/`repair` postures and requires a `strict` parse to REJECT
# a repeated raw "@" -- RFC 3986 admits no unescaped "@" in either `userinfo`
# or `reg-name`.
#
# `host_pct` -- how a host that PARSED is spelled back. Rendering only:
#
#   "decode"  report the host with every triplet decoded. The no-selector
#             default, and what WHATWG stores.
#   "keep"    report it with only the unreserved triplets decoded and the rest
#             left encoded, hex uppercased (RFC 3986 sections 6.2.2.2 and
#             6.2.2.1). The RFC posture preserves a reg-name's source spelling
#             instead of inventing a decoded one.
#
# Note what "keep" does NOT do: on its own it does not stop VALIDATING the
# decoded host. Whether `reg-name` admits any well-formed triplet whatever it
# decodes to is a separate acceptance question, and it is `host_pct_octets`
# that answers it (RURL-crrgaiel) -- not this dial.
#
# `host_charset` -- which literal ASCII bytes a host may CONTAIN. Acceptance
# only, and a property of the selected standard that no input can reveal:
#
#   "narrow"  libcurl's measured host set (`.WEB_HOST_ALLOWED_BYTES`). The
#             no-selector default.
#   "whatwg"  plus the 15 code points WHATWG keeps in a host
#             (`.WEB_HOST_GAP_BYTES`), literally AND percent-encoded: WHATWG's
#             host parser percent-decodes first and only then checks forbidden
#             domain code points, and "`" is not one of them, so `%60` must
#             parse exactly as the literal "`" does.
#   "rfc3986" plus the 11 `sub-delims` (`.WEB_HOST_SUBDELIM_BYTES`) literally,
#             and the full 15 once decoded -- see `.web_parse_host()` for why
#             the two differ here and nowhere else.
#
# The two are SEPARATE dials because the three standards do not agree on the
# diagonal: `rfc3986` pairs "keep" rendering with the 11-byte literal set,
# `whatwg` pairs "decode" with the 15-byte one, and the no-selector baseline
# pairs "decode" with neither. A single dial had to pick one axis and smuggle
# the other, which is how a value named after percent-decoding ended up
# deciding whether a literal "!" was a legal host byte.
#
# Both were compensated for OUTSIDE the parser until ADR 0013, and each
# compensation failed in its own way. The percent half masked every host
# triplet as filler so the decode could not happen, which also hid the rest of
# the host from every check the parser makes (RURL-rgjpcbuk / deletion 2). The
# literal half substituted filler for the gap bytes and restored the true host
# afterwards, gated by a regex whose blind spots decided acceptance
# (`.web_parse_host()` lists them).
#
# `pqf_bytes` -- what a C0 control, SP or DEL in path/query/fragment means:
#
#   "reject"  a parse error, which is what libcurl did. The no-selector default
#             and the `rfc3986` setting -- neither `pchar`, `query` nor
#             `fragment` admits those octets raw, and RFC 3986 has no
#             escape-it-for-me rule to fall back on.
#   "encode"  percent-encoded in place. WHATWG's path/query/fragment states do
#             not reject: they run each code point through a percent-encode set,
#             so an unwritable byte is ESCAPED. Nothing here applies the rest of
#             those sets ("<", "`", '"' ...) -- that is RENDERING, it belongs to
#             the serializer, and the serializer already does it.
#
# This too was compensated for outside the parser, and in a way that shows why
# it could not stay there: `.sanitize_whatwg_pqf_vec()` re-spelled the input
# with the full WHATWG encode sets and re-parsed after the first attempt failed
# (RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 5). Because the retry was gated on FAILURE and rewrote
# all three components at once, whether a "<" in the QUERY was stored as "<" or
# "%3C" was decided by whether the PATH happened to hold a space. Acceptance and
# spelling are separate axes; a second parse of a rewritten string conflates
# them by construction.
#
# `pqf_source` -- how the ACCEPTED query and fragment are STORED
# (RURL-gkmwqpos, RUL-007). Acceptance is `pqf_bytes`'s question and is
# unchanged by this dial: the component pass still runs, and a rejection is
# still a rejection.
#
#   "normalize"  the component pass's output: bytes >= 0x80 percent-encoded,
#                then every "%XX" uppercased. The no-selector default and the
#                `whatwg` setting -- what both have always stored.
#   "preserve"   the source slice with the `pqf_bytes = "encode"` escapes
#                applied (as `.extract_raw_path_vec()` applies them to the
#                path via `.web_escape_pqf_bytes()`) and NOTHING else: an
#                existing "%xx" keeps its hex case and a raw byte >= 0x80
#                stays raw, exactly as the re-derived path keeps both. The
#                `rfc3986` setting: RFC 3986 sec 6.2.2.1 makes hex-digit case
#                folding a NORMALIZATION, and sec 2.1 makes a triplet a
#                REPRESENTATION of the octet it encodes, so both spellings
#                belong to the `normalized` serializer form and neither to the
#                parse record or the `source` form (RUL-007 for the fold,
#                RUL-015 for the octet -- which RUL-007 had left encoded here
#                as a residual, pinned by `external-url-vectors.csv`'s
#                `fsss_rfc_source` column until that column was re-measured).
#
# `host_ipv4` -- which host tokens are read as an IPv4 ADDRESS:
#
#   "narrow"  the historical set. No empty hex digits, no trailing dot, a
#             lowercase "0x" prefix only. The no-selector default and the
#             `rfc3986` setting.
#   "whatwg"  WHATWG's IPv4 parser, which reads all three of them
#             (`.web_ipv4_normalize()` lists them). A strict SUPERSET of
#             "narrow", agreeing on every value they both accept.
#
# The last of the five compensations to move in (RURL-ezhzpkhg deletion 4), and
# the one whose regex gate did more than narrow a set. `(.*)$` let ICU's "$"
# match BEFORE a trailing line terminator, so a URL ending in a raw VT, FF, LS,
# PS or NEL was reassembled WITHOUT it -- a fired rewrite silently deleted a
# byte from the URL. The same pattern also hard-required a literal "//" and,
# through the same ICU ".", skipped any URL carrying one of those terminators
# anywhere after the authority. Reading the host token the parser already cut is
# not a tidy-up; it is the only way the answer stops depending on the rest of
# the string.
