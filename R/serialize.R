# Output surface (b) -- the public entry point for the full-string standard
# serializers (FSSS). The serializers themselves live in R/parse-phases.R
# (.serialize_whatwg_full_vec / .serialize_rfc_full_vec); everything here is the
# build of the LOSSLESS SERIALIZER-INPUT RECORD they consume, plus the exported
# wrapper.
#
# Surface discipline (design/work/url-v3/contracts/output-contracts.md):
#
#   * This is NOT `clean_url`. `clean_url` is surface (c), a policy-driven
#     SEO/canonicalization product that is explicitly "not a serializer,
#     identity, redirect target, or conformance oracle" (P2.2 sec 1c/5.1). The
#     two surfaces are separate by contract (C-04), not two versions of one
#     thing, and this file never calls the clean assembly path.
#   * NO PRESENTATION DIAL reaches this surface (C-05, ADR 0011).
#     `serialize_url` takes no `port_handling`, `trailing_slash_handling`,
#     `path_encoding`, `www_handling`, `index_page_handling` or query-filter
#     argument, and the record builder below pins every one of them to its
#     identity value. The
#     only knobs are `standard` and `form`, which select WHICH standard's
#     serialization is being asked for -- not how to dress it up.
#   * The record is built from the PARSE state, never from the 18-field public
#     projection (S3-F2). `.blank_to_na()` collapses "" to NA on the way out of
#     Stage A, which destroys the empty-vs-absent distinction a full-string
#     serializer needs, so the three-valued presence facts are recovered
#     lexically from the source instead (.fsss_source_lex below).

# Parse posture per standard. Both are EXISTING public profiles, deliberately:
# the FSSS serializes what the standard's own parser accepted, so the parse
# posture must be the standard's, not rurl's web-cleaning default.
#
#   whatwg     -> scheme_acceptance "general", scheme_policy "require"
#                 (absolute-URL, no-base spec posture; scheme-less input is a
#                 parse failure under WHATWG without a base URL, so `require`
#                 is the conformant reading, not a foot-gun).
#   rfc-syntax -> the same acceptance/policy with no normalization at all, which
#                 is what `form = "source"` needs. `form = "normalized"` uses
#                 the SAME parse posture and applies RFC 3986 sec 6.2.2/6.2.3
#                 inside the serializer, so the two forms differ only in
#                 normalization and never in what was accepted.

# Lexical recovery of the facts Stage A cannot carry.
#
# Two of the record's fields are DELIMITER facts, not value facts, and Stage A
# reports both through `.blank_to_na()`-collapsed values: `http://h/?` and
# `http://h/` both arrive with `raw_query = NA`. `query_kind`/`fragment_kind`
# are three-valued precisely so a present-but-empty delimiter survives
# (ADR 0012 D2), so they are read off the source string here. The undivided
# `userinfo` slice is recovered the same way -- the web-route parser hands back
# a `user`/`password` split, and RFC 3986 has no such split to reconstruct
# from -- and so is the `host` slice, which that parser percent-decodes and
# case-folds during the parse (RURL-xkhbhaje).
#
# The WHATWG strips (tab/LF/CR removal, then the leading/trailing
# C0-control-or-space run) are applied only under `whatwg`, matching
# `._prepare_urls_vec`; under `rfc3986` the source is read verbatim, which is
# what the source-preserving posture requires.
# The host of a userinfo-free authority: an unterminated "[" keeps everything
# (there is no IP-literal to delimit), a terminated one stops at "]", and any
# other authority drops the last ":"-introduced run, which is the port.
#
# Located AND cut in BYTES (RURL-kmpnbvdl). Shared with the parse-side shim, so
# both sides of the seam have to survive the same input: an authority captured
# by stringi arrives DECLARED UTF-8 whatever its octets, and character-indexed
# slicing throws `invalid multibyte string` on `<80>:80`. Byte indices are also
# the only ones that agree with the locating scan under `LC_ALL=C`.

  # which is exactly what RFC 3986's source-preserving posture emits, and what
  # section 6.2.2.2 normalization must be applied TO rather than after
  # (RURL-xkhbhaje). Host = the authority after any userinfo, minus a trailing
  # ":port"; a bracketed IPv6 literal keeps its "[...]" and its inner colons.
  #
  # Both slices are cut by POSITION rather than by an anchored regex. A regex
  # "." does not match a line terminator and "$" matches before a trailing one,
  # so an authority carrying a raw NEL/LS/PS -- all of which reach here, since
  # the RFC posture strips nothing -- would keep its userinfo and emit it twice.
  # The position is a BYTE position (RURL-kmpnbvdl). `authority` comes from
  # `stri_match_first_regex()`, which declares every capture UTF-8 whatever
  # octets it holds, so a source carrying a stray `<80>` made `substring()`
  # throw `invalid multibyte string` and took the whole `serialize_url()` call
  # -- the FSSS conformance oracle -- down with it. Bytes also keep the locate
  # and the cut in the same unit, which is what makes the slice agree with

#
# Every transform applied here is one the SELECTED STANDARD's parser performs;
# none is a cleaning or presentation step:
#
#   * host -- WHATWG's host parser emits the ASCII (punycode) domain, lower-
#     cased, so `host_encoding = "idna"` is the standard's own rendering, not
#     the `clean_url` default (`keep`, which leaves the Unicode spelling).
#     Applied only to hosts D2 makes transform-eligible: an opaque general host
#     is not a domain and is never routed through domain.R (ADR 0002).
#   * path -- WHATWG's parser resolves dot segments during parsing. RFC keeps
#     the source path; `form = "normalized"` removes dot segments inside the
#     serializer (sec 6.2.2.3), where it belongs.
#   * port -- WHATWG's parser sets the port to null when it equals the scheme's
#     default, so the record carries no default port. This is a PARSE fact,
#     which is why the serializer emits whatever port it is handed. RFC keeps
#     it; the normalized form elides it per sec 6.2.3.
#
# `opts` exists ONLY so a second identity surface can reuse this builder under a
# DIFFERENT parse posture without duplicating it. Surface (b) never passes it
# and is byte-for-byte unaffected; surface (e), the comparison key, passes its
# bundle because the FSSS posture (`scheme_policy = "require"`) makes every
# scheme-less input a parse failure, which would leave the key's missing-scheme
# truth-table rows unreachable (`contracts/key-join-contracts.md:112-115`).

#' Serialize URLs to a standard's own full-string form
#'
#' Renders each URL as the selected standard would serialize it: the
#' **full string**, credentials and fragment included, with a present-but-empty
#' `?` or `#` delimiter preserved. This is rurl's *standard serialization*
#' surface, and it is deliberately **not** [get_clean_url()].
#'
#' @section Which surface you want:
#'
#' `serialize_url()` answers *"what does this URL look like under the URL
#' Standard / RFC 3986?"*. [get_clean_url()] answers *"what is the canonical,
#' tidied form of this URL for SEO or deduplication?"*. They are different
#' products, not two settings of one:
#'
#' * `serialize_url()` preserves userinfo, the fragment, and empty delimiters;
#'   takes **no** presentation options; and is the substrate rurl's conformance
#'   claims are measured on.
#' * [get_clean_url()] drops userinfo and the fragment by design, and is driven
#'   by cleaning policy (`www_handling`, `trailing_slash_handling`,
#'   `index_page_handling`, query filtering, port handling, and so on).
#'
#' Because a standard serialization is an *identity*, `serialize_url()` accepts
#' no presentation arguments at all. There is no `port_handling`,
#' `trailing_slash_handling` or `path_encoding` to pass; asking a serializer to
#' strip a trailing slash would be a category error.
#'
#' @section Parse posture:
#'
#' Each standard is parsed under its own spec posture -- the `"whatwg"` and
#' `"rfc-syntax"` profiles (see [url_profile()]). Both accept any scheme, and
#' both **require** a scheme: neither standard defines a base-URL-free parse of
#' `example.com/x`, so scheme-less input returns `NA` rather than being silently
#' upgraded to `https://`. Input that the standard's parser rejects also returns
#' `NA`.
#'
#' @section Standards and forms:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`standard = "whatwg"`}{The WHATWG URL Standard's URL serializer
#'     (`#concept-url-serializer`). Spec-exact, which makes credentials lossy in
#'     one direction: WHATWG appends credentials only when the username or
#'     password is non-empty, so `http://@h/` serializes as `http://h/` and
#'     `http://u:@h/` as `http://u@h/`. Both are pinned by the Web Platform
#'     Tests. `form` is ignored.}
#'   \item{`standard = "rfc3986", form = "source"`}{RFC 3986 section 5.3
#'     component recomposition with **no** normalization: source bytes are
#'     preserved and the undivided `userinfo` slice is emitted verbatim (RFC
#'     3986 has no username/password split), so every credential spelling `u@`,
#'     `u:@`, `:p@`, `@` -- survives.}
#'   \item{`standard = "rfc3986", form = "normalized"`}{Adds RFC 3986 section
#'     6.2.2 syntax-based normalization (scheme and host case, percent-encoding
#'     triplet case and unreserved-octet decoding, dot-segment removal) and the
#'     section 6.2.3 default-port elision.}
#' }
#'
#' Both RFC forms are exposed because choosing one would forfeit either the
#' round-trip oracle (`source`) or the normalized comparison substrate
#' (`normalized`).
#'
#' @param url A character vector of URLs.
#' @param standard The standard to serialize to: `"whatwg"` (default) or
#'   `"rfc3986"`. Unlike the parse surface, `NULL` is not accepted: the parse
#'   surface's `url_standard = NULL` is a frozen legacy profile that names no
#'   standard (ADR 0007), so there is nothing to serialize *as*. Passing
#'   `NULL` is an error rather than a silent `"whatwg"`.
#' @param form For `standard = "rfc3986"` only, the RFC posture: `"source"`
#'   (default, source-preserving) or `"normalized"`. Ignored for `"whatwg"`,
#'   whose serializer has a single spec-defined form.
#' @param engine Optional `psl_engine` object from `pslr::psl_engine()` for
#'   per-request Public Suffix List resolution. `NULL` (default) uses the
#'   session-global engine.
#'
