# Parsing phases: the decomposed helpers behind the parse engine.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each phase owns one normalization step. The `*_vec` functions are the real,
# vectorized implementation: they accept and return length-n column vectors
# (options are validated scalars per call, so every switch()/if hoists OUTSIDE
# the vector ops -- each phase is straight-line vectorized code selected once).
# The vector engine chains them in two stages (parse.R): ._parse_stage_a_vec()
# runs the option-independent, cacheable phases and ._parse_stage_b_vec() runs
# the presentation phases over the cached Stage A columns.
#
# The scalar helpers of the same base name are kept as thin wrappers that
# delegate to their `*_vec` counterpart on a length-1 input, so the per-phase
# unit tests (test-parse-phases.R) still pin behavior through them and the
# scalar orchestrator ._safe_parse_url_impl() (parse.R) keeps working.
# .parse_web_url_one()/.extract_raw_components() stay scalar because the web
# parser is scalar; the engine reuses it in its single per-URL loop
# and extracts the raw columns itself.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 1 helper (vector): classify the host token of each raw input for the
# host-shape gate. rurl only fabricates a scheme for URL-shaped input, so we
# must isolate and inspect the host before the web parse. Returns, per element:
#   has_userinfo    - an '@' appears in the authority (user[:pass]@host)
#   is_localhost    - the bare host is an allowlisted single-label host
#   is_dotted_name  - >= 2 non-empty dot-separated labels (example.com, a.b.c)
#   is_ipish        - the host is an IP *attempt*: all-decimal / 0x-hex / octal
#                     / short-form groups, or anything containing ':' (IPv6)
#   is_canonical_ip - a valid IPv4 dotted-quad or bracketed IPv6 per the strict
#                     detector (rejects leading-zero octets and coerced forms)
# Purely a function of the input string; used to drive rejection in Phase 1.

# Phase 1 helper (vector): WHATWG literal backslash-as-slash recognition
# (RURL-ledntyab, PRD v2 D2, §5.2). Under url_standard = "whatwg", for schemes
# in .WHATWG_SPECIAL_SCHEMES (http/https/ftp/file -- NOT ftps, which WHATWG
# does not define as special), a literal backslash is treated identically to a
# forward slash everywhere the WHATWG state machine checks for one: the
# scheme-relative "//" marker, the authority/path boundary, and path-segment
# separators. For rurl's authority-based special schemes (http/https/ftp), the
# same pre-parse step also implements the WHATWG special-authority-slashes
# state for inputs with no slash run at all: `http:example.com` is handed to the
# parser as `http://example.com`. This must run BEFORE the parse (the parser
# never treats "\" as a separator and rejects missing `//` authority forms), so
# it rewrites the raw string here in Phase 1, ahead of every other scheme/host
# regex in this function -- once rewritten, the existing "://"/"//" detection,
# host classification, and the parser handoff need no further changes.
#
# The leading run right after "scheme:" is handled as its own case (mirroring
# the WHATWG "special authority slashes"/"special authority ignore slashes"
# states) rather than a blind 1:1 "\" -> "/" substitution: that run -- of ANY
# length and ANY mix of "/" and "\" -- is collapsed to exactly "//" before
# authority parsing continues, so a single "\" (RURL-ledntyab's own acceptance
# case "http:\host\path"), a double "\\" ("http:\\host\path"), and an
# already-canonical "//" all normalize the same way. A run of length 0 (no
# separator at all, e.g. "http:host/path") is authority-introducing for the
# http/https/ftp subset, but not for file (left to the file-state slice). AFTER
# the authority marker, a literal "\" remains a plain 1:1 "\" -> "/" rewrite
# (path-segment separators, and the authority/path boundary when it isn't part
# of the run).
#
# Recognition only, no decoding: `%5C` (a percent-encoded backslash) is inert
# literal text here, never treated as a separator -- it contains no actual
# backslash byte. The query and fragment are never touched: only the span from
# just after "scheme:" up to the first literal "?"/"#" is eligible, so a
# backslash inside `?q=a\b#frag\c` stays untouched even on a rewritten row.
#
# Returns `url` (rewritten for eligible rows, unchanged otherwise) and
# `backslash_rewritten`, a logical mask marking rows where a literal "\" byte
# actually participated in a rewrite (in the leading run or the remainder) --
# used to emit the `invalid-reverse-solidus` diagnostic. A leading run that was
# ALREADY all forward slashes (a plain "http://", or the spec-accurate
# multi-slash collapse of e.g. "http:///host") changes no backslash, so it does
# NOT set this flag even though the string may still be rewritten.

#   1b. Remove ALL ASCII tab (U+0009), LF (U+000A) and CR (U+000D) from the
#       input, everywhere in the string.
# Both run before any component is parsed, so every downstream scheme/host
# regex and the backslash recognizer see the already-stripped string. rurl
# otherwise rejects a control char in the authority (the parser errors) and
# percent-encodes a trailing space into the path -- correct under RFC 3986,
# which has no strip step and requires such bytes to be percent-encoded -- so
# this runs ONLY under url_standard == "whatwg" and is a byte-for-byte no-op
# otherwise. Note the spec order matters for fact attribution: a LEADING tab is
# removed by 1a, not 1b.
#

#     1b; other interior C0 controls are left to the web parser.
# A row can carry both. Resolves the control-char-in-authority family: c0-tab

# WHATWG / UTS-46 alternative full-stop mapping (RURL-odsmwsxu). UTS-46
# domain-to-ASCII -- the "map" step the WHATWG host parser runs for special

# host is split into labels: U+3002 (ideographic full stop), U+FF0E (fullwidth
# full stop), and U+FF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop). rurl hands the raw
# string to the web parser, which does NOT apply UTS-46, so a Unicode-dot host
# like "127。0。0。1" reaches it with its separators intact, is never split into
# numeric labels, and so never coerces to the canonical dotted-quad (an
# SSRF-relevant loopback/metadata obfuscation -- browsers coerce). The upstream
# host-shape gate is no help either: .classify_input_host_vec()'s ipv4-attempt
# test splits on ASCII "." only, so a literal-Unicode-dot host is not even seen
# as an IPv4 attempt. Mapping the three code points to "." here, BEFORE the
# parse,
# lets the existing IPv4 coercion and label handling see "127.0.0.1" (and, for
# names, "例え。jp" -> "例え.jp").
#
# SCOPED TO THE AUTHORITY ONLY. A full-stop variant in the path/query/fragment
# is legitimate content (e.g. a path "/文書。pdf") and MUST NOT be rewritten, so
# only the authority span -- between the "//" that introduces it and the first
# "/", "?" or "#" -- is eligible. The whole authority (userinfo + host + port)
# is mapped rather than the host alone: a variant full stop in userinfo is a
# negligible edge (userinfo is not itself a domain) and not worth splitting the
# authority to exclude. Opaque "scheme:foo" inputs (no "//") carry no authority
# and are left untouched; a backslash run has already been collapsed to "//"
# upstream, so this sees the normalized form. Runs ONLY under url_standard ==
# "whatwg" (RFC 3986 has no UTS-46 mapping -- these bytes stay literal), and is
# a byte-for-byte no-op otherwise. Recognition only: a percent-encoded form
# ("%E3%80%82") is inert literal text, never mapped. No diagnostic is emitted --

# is a member of the WHATWG userinfo percent-encode set, i.e. the

# to parse with `decode = FALSE`, so no restore step is needed (contrast the ADR

# A deterministic single pass, gated on fixup_posture == "browser", that repairs
# the raw input string before any parsing. A byte-for-byte no-op for every other
# posture (returns `url` untouched), so the default parse path is unchanged.
#
# Steps (each feeds the next):
#   1. Outer C0/space trim -- strip leading/trailing U+0000..U+0020 from the
#      whole input (WHATWG "C0 control or space"). This trim has a whatwg-gated
#      sibling: WHATWG step 1's first half, in
#      .strip_whatwg_control_chars_vec() (RURL-yvxpanix), does the same trim for
#      every posture when url_standard == "whatwg". This one stays load-bearing
#      because it is the ONLY outer trim under url_standard = "rfc3986" / no
#      selector, where step 1 does not run at all.
#   2. `;`->`:` -- rewrite a leading `scheme;` to `scheme:` ONLY when the scheme
#      token is in the recognized-scheme set. A `;` after any other token is
#      left verbatim.
#   3. `://` insertion -- insert `://` after `scheme:` for a scheme in the
#      authority table that is missing its authority slashes (e.g.
#      `http:example.com` -> `http://example.com`). Outside the set: verbatim.
#
# Both tables resolve to the SAME set = .WHATWG_SPECIAL_SCHEMES (referenced
# directly, not copied). `ftps` is naturally excluded (it is not special under
# WHATWG), so `ftps;host`/`ftps:host` stay verbatim -- no special-casing.
# Step 4 (fallback `http`) is NOT here: it is the existing scheme_policy =
# "infer" prepend seam (ADR 0012 D4).

# `rfc3986` keeps a reg-name's percent-encoding in the host IDENTITY (host_pct =

# read a label containing "%", so a percent-encoded IDN host would carry no
# domain/TLD at all. RFC 3986 §3.2.2 explicitly admits percent-encoded UTF-8
# non-ASCII names in reg-name and requires IDNA transformation before a DNS
# lookup, while §6.2.2.2 authorizes only unreserved decoding for URI
# normalization -- so the decoded view is a legitimate basis for a DNS-facing
# ANNOTATION even though it must never become the identity.
#
# Hence: decode EXACTLY ONCE as UTF-8, solely to build the candidate. This must
# not affect acceptance, `final_host`, serialization, or identity -- it is
# reachable only from this function, which returns domain/TLD and nothing else.
#
# "Exactly once" is well defined here because no ACCEPTED host can carry a
# literal "%": an input spelling one (`%25`) is rejected under every profile, so
# a "%" in `final_host` is always an undecoded triplet. Verified across the
# whole octet sweep, not assumed.
#
# A failed decode (a malformed triplet, a decoded NUL) or a decode that is not
# valid UTF-8 yields NA -- the `unknown` annotation. `validUTF8()` is the
# validator on purpose: it is byte-based and locale-independent (the
# RURL-kmpnbvdl defect class), and strict enough to reject overlong forms and
# encoded surrogates, which are not legitimate spellings of a code point.
#
# Everything after the decode is the EXISTING pslr path, deliberately: the
# annotation for an `rfc3986` host then agrees with the one `whatwg` computes
# for the same decoded host, including its rejections (U+FFFD stays unknown, a
# soft hyphen is mapped away by IDNA).

#
# These render a clean_url-style string for the non-special / opaque /
# empty-host / RFC-generic URL shapes that the (not-yet-public) `general`
# acceptance will produce. They are PURELY ADDITIVE: L4b activates `general`
# and wires them into the Phase-11 dispatch. Nothing here is called from the
# live pipeline, so byte-identity of every existing output is automatic.
# `.build_clean_url_vec` above is left verbatim as the special/host-present
# serializer L4b keeps using.
#
# Both follow rurl's clean_url product contract: the FRAGMENT is EXCLUDED, and
# an empty-but-PRESENT query serializes as a trailing "?". They take
# already-parsed state as explicit args (the state vocabulary from
# R/parse-state.R: host_kind, path_kind, query_kind, rfc_path_form) and use the
# repo's pre-allocate + logical-mask assignment idiom.

# Does the WHATWG serializer emit the `//` authority introducer for this row?
#
# The standard names ONE condition -- "if url's host is non-null, append //"
# (#concept-url-serializer step 2) -- so this is `host_kind != "absent"` and
# nothing else. The `authority_delimiter_present` syntactic fact is NOT
# consulted: it is a property of the SOURCE string, and WHATWG serializes the
# parsed URL, not the source.
#
# THIS REPLACES P1.2 D-C, which keyed the introducer off
# `authority_delimiter_present` because `host_kind` "cannot tell a
# delimiter-present empty authority from a delimiter-absent input". That
# premise was itself the defect (RURL-uhwivndf): the only rows where the two
# collapsed were `file:` rows whose host the parser recorded as NULL where
# WHATWG gives every special scheme a non-null -- here empty -- host. With the
# `file:` host model repaired in `.parse_whatwg_file_urls_vec()`, host_kind
# distinguishes them, and the two conditions agree on every WPT success row
# EXCEPT the ten this fixes. `authority_delimiter_present` stays in the record
# and stays load-bearing for the RFC serializers, where the source spelling IS
# the fact being rendered.

# FSSS -- the full-string standard serializers (output surface (b)).
#
# These are the STANDARD serializers. The `.serialize_*_vec()` pair above are
# the CLEAN serializers (surface c): they implement rurl's `clean_url` product
# contract, which excludes the fragment and credentials by design. The two are
# separate surfaces, not versions of one thing (output-contracts.md, C-04).
#
# Three properties distinguish the FSSS, all contractual:
#
#   1. FULL-STRING. Credentials and the fragment are emitted, and a delimiter
#      that was present with an empty value survives as a trailing `?` / `#`
#      (ADR 0012 D2).
#   2. IDENTITY, NOT PRESENTATION. They take NO presentation dial -- no
#      `port_handling`, no `trailing_slash_handling`, no `path_encoding`. The
#      path is rendered by the selected standard's own percent-encode set and
#      `path_encoding` is never consulted (output-contracts.md, C-05; ADR 0011).
#      Passing one would be a category error, so there is no argument to pass.
#   3. LOSSLESS RECORD IN. They consume the lossless serializer-input record
#      (the R/parse-state.R vocabulary), never the 18-field public projection
#      and never a cleaned or formatted component (S3-F2).
#
# `port` is the identity port and is emitted whenever it is non-NA. The
# public projection's default-port nulling is a projection policy applied
# downstream; it is not this surface's business.

# WHATWG userinfo percent-encode set (#userinfo-percent-encode-set): the path
# set plus `/ : ; = @ [ \ ] ^ |`. `^` is already a path-set member.

# `http://u:@h/` as `http://u@h/`, both pinned by WPT. The undivided source
# userinfo is NOT used: this serializer emits the standard's own serialization
# of the parsed state, and WHATWG's state is the username/password split. The
# LOSSLESSNESS the contract requires lives in the RECORD (which keeps the
# undivided slice), not in this serializer's output; the RFC source-preserving
# form below is where the undivided spelling is rendered verbatim.

# Round-tripping is unaffected: the identity oracle is idempotence of
