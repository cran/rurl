# Layered validation verdicts (P1.1 §2 + P2.3 §1-§5, projected by G3.6's
# validation-intervention contract; RURL-glkuulyr).
#
# The single `parse_status` column conflates three INDEPENDENT questions. This
# file separates them and then projects them back:
#
#   L1 syntax   -- did the input present a well-formed URL under the selected
#                  standard? Fatality: `fail` is structural.
#   L2 policy   -- is an already-parsed object admitted, and with what note,
#                  under the active acceptance/relative/userinfo policy?
#                  Fatality: `rejected-scheme` rejects; `warn-userinfo` accepts
#                  with a note.
#   L3 annotation -- the PSL registrability fact, as a TYPED state rather than a
#                  bare NA. NEVER fatal, and it MUST NOT change L1 or L2.
#
# `parse_status` is retained unchanged as the total, pure projection
# pi(L1, L2, L3) below -- the sole locus at which a PSL fact reaches a
# status-shaped output. The projection is LOSSY by contract: an L1 structural
# failure and an L2 admission rejection both collapse to `error`, and only the
# companion `get_parse_verdicts()` recovers which one occurred.
#
# BYTE-IDENTITY IS STRUCTURAL, NOT PARALLEL. `.derive_parse_status_vec()` is
# implemented AS `.project_parse_status_vec(.derive_verdict_layers_vec(...))`,
# so there is exactly one status-deciding code path. A second implementation
# kept "in sync by testing" is the duplication this epic keeps paying for.

# --- public companion --------------------------------------------------------

#' Report the layered validation verdicts for each URL
#'
#' Companion helper that separates the three independent questions
#' \code{\link{get_parse_status}} collapses into one value: did the input
#' present well-formed URL syntax (layer 1), was the parsed object admitted
#' under the active policy (layer 2), and what did the Public Suffix List
#' annotation find (layer 3).
#'
#' The single \code{parse_status} value is a \emph{lossy} projection of these
#' three. The guaranteed loss is that a structural syntax failure and a policy
#' rejection both surface as \code{"error"}: under the default
#' \code{scheme_acceptance = "web"}, \code{"mailto:jane@example.com"} and
#' \code{"http://"} are both \code{"error"}, but the first is
#' \code{layer2_policy_verdict = "rejected-scheme"} (rurl declined to accept the
#' scheme) while the second is \code{layer1_syntax_verdict = "fail"} (it did not
#' parse). Recovering that distinction is what this helper is for.
#'
#' Like the other companion helpers this never widens the
#' \code{\link{safe_parse_url}} frame --- the parse table keeps its 18 columns
#' and the verdicts live here. Unlike \code{\link{get_host_type}} and
#' \code{\link{get_scheme_class}}, which require a selector, it is fully
#' defined at \code{url_standard = NULL}: layers 1 and 2 describe the parse
#' that actually occurred, which happens with or without a standard selector.
#'
#' @section Why this helper is not gated on \code{url_standard}:
#'   \code{\link{get_host_type}} and \code{\link{get_scheme_class}}
#'   \emph{require} a selector and error without one (ADR 0015). That
#'   requirement is not a house style --- it is a consequence of what those
#'   helpers report. Their content is \emph{standard-relative}: whether a host
#'   is an IPv4 address, or a scheme is special, is a question only a standard
#'   can answer, so without a selector there is no fact to return.
#'
#'   Verdict layers are not standard-relative in that way. A syntax failure
#'   (layer 1) and an admission rejection (layer 2) are facts about the parse
#'   \emph{that this call actually performed}, under whatever options were
#'   supplied. Those facts exist at \code{url_standard = NULL} exactly as they
#'   do under a selector, so there is nothing to withhold.
#'
#'   Gating anyway would also break the helper's central guarantee. Because
#'   \code{parse_status} is the projection of these three layers, projecting
#'   the reported layers must reproduce the reported status. Refusing to answer
#'   at \code{url_standard = NULL} while \code{parse_status} still reports a
#'   real value would make the companion contradict the column it exists to
#'   explain --- on the most common call, and precisely when a caller is asking
#'   why a default-options parse failed.
#'
#' @section Layers:
#'   \strong{Layer 1 --- syntax} (\code{"pass"} / \code{"fail"}). Whether a
#'   syntax failure was \emph{observed}. \code{"pass"} is the absence of an
#'   observed failure, not a proof of conformance --- a row the admission gate
#'   rejected before any parse ran reports its rejection in layer 2 and is not
#'   additionally reported as a syntax failure.
#'
#'   \strong{Layer 2 --- policy} (\code{"admitted"},
#'   \code{"admitted-scheme-relative"}, \code{"admitted-ftp"},
#'   \code{"rejected-scheme"}, \code{"warn-userinfo"}). Whether the object is
#'   admitted under the active \code{scheme_acceptance} /
#'   \code{scheme_relative_handling} / userinfo policy, and with what note.
#'   \code{"rejected-scheme"} rejects; \code{"warn-userinfo"} accepts with a
#'   note; the \code{admitted*} values accept.
#'
#'   \strong{Layer 3 --- annotation} (\code{"not-applicable"},
#'   \code{"known"}, \code{"unknown"}, and the currently unproduced
#'   \code{"not-requested"}, \code{"invalid-input"}, \code{"dependency-error"}).
#'   The PSL registrability fact as a typed state rather than a bare
#'   \code{NA}, and \strong{never fatal}: a host with no public suffix is a
#'   \code{"unknown"} annotation, not a parse failure. A host form with no
#'   registrable-domain concept at all --- an IP literal, a \code{file:} host,
#'   an opaque authority --- is \code{"not-applicable"}, never \code{"unknown"}.
#'
#' @param url A character vector of URLs.
#' @param url_standard Standard profile governing interpretation: \code{NULL}
#'   (default), \code{"rfc3986"}, or \code{"whatwg"}. Unlike the other
#'   companion helpers this argument does not gate the result.
#' @inheritParams safe_parse_url
#' @return A data frame with one row per element of \code{url} and three
#'   character columns: \code{layer1_syntax_verdict},
#'   \code{layer2_policy_verdict}, and \code{layer3_annotation_state}.
#' @seealso \code{\link{get_parse_status}}, \code{\link{get_url_diagnostics}},
