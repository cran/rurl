# URL parsing: public parse functions, scalar wrapper, and impl orchestration.

#' Parse a URL comprehensively, extracting and deriving all relevant components.
#'
#' This function serves as the core URL processing engine. It parses a URL,
#' handles protocol and www prefix modifications, detects IP addresses,
#' and derives components like the registered domain and top-level domain (TLD).
#' Results are memoized for performance when processing large datasets.
#'
#' @param url A single URL string to be parsed. For vectors, use
#'   \code{\link{safe_parse_urls}}.
#' @param protocol_handling A character string specifying how to handle
#'   protocols. Defaults to "keep".
#'   Regardless of this option, rurl only processes authority-based URLs whose
#'   scheme is one of http, https, ftp, or ftps; a scheme-bearing input with any
#'   other scheme (e.g. \code{mailto:}, \code{tel:}, \code{ws:}) yields
#'   \code{parse_status = "error"}. Scheme inference (below) also requires the
#'   input to be host-shaped: a scheme-less string that is not a host (e.g.
#'   \code{"asdfghjkl"}, \code{"12345"}, \code{"/path"}) or is a non-canonical
#'   IP literal (integer/hex/octal/short forms, or leading-zero octets like
#'   \code{"192.168.010.1"}) is rejected as \code{"error"} rather than having a
#'   scheme fabricated for it.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"keep": If a supported scheme exists (http, https, ftp, ftps), it's
#'     used. If no scheme and the input is host-shaped, "http://" is added;
#'     otherwise the input is not a URL and yields \code{"error"}.}
#'     \item{"none": If a supported scheme exists, it's used. If no scheme, then
#'     no scheme is used (scheme component will be NA).}
#'     \item{"strip": Any existing scheme is removed (scheme component will be
#'     NA).}
#'     \item{"http": The scheme is forced to be "http".}
#'     \item{"https": The scheme is forced to be "https".}
#'   }
#' @param www_handling A character string specifying how to handle "www"
#'   and `www[number]` prefixes in the host. Defaults to "none".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"none": (Default) Leaves the host's www prefix (or lack thereof)
#'     untouched.}
#'     \item{"strip": Removes any "www." or `www[number].` prefix.}
#'     \item{"keep": Ensures the host starts with "www.". If it has
#'     `www[number].`, it's normalized to "www.". If no www prefix, "www." is
#'     added. An empty input host remains empty.}
#'     \item{"if_no_subdomain": If the host is a bare registered domain (e.g.,
#'     "example.com"), "www." is added. If the host already has a "www." or
#'     `www[number].` prefix, it is normalized to "www." (e.g.,
#'     "www1.example.com" becomes "www.example.com"; "www1.sub.example.com"
#'     becomes "www.sub.example.com"). If a non-www subdomain exists (e.g.,
#'     "sub.example.com" or the normalized "www.sub.example.com"), the host is
#'     not further altered. An empty input host remains empty.}
#'   }
#' @param tld_source Which TLD source to use for TLD extraction: "all", "icann",
#'   or "private". Defaults to "all".
#' @param case_handling A character string specifying how to handle the case of
#'                      the cleaned URL. Defaults to "lower_host", the
#'                      RFC 3986 §6.2.2.1 normalization (scheme and host are
#'                      case-insensitive and folded to lowercase; the path is
#'                      case-sensitive and preserved).
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"lower_host": (Default) Lowercases scheme and host only; the path
#'     keeps its original casing.}
#'     \item{"keep": Preserves casing of the reconstructed URL.}
#'     \item{"lower": Converts the cleaned URL to lowercase.}
#'     \item{"upper": Converts the cleaned URL to uppercase.}
#'   }
#' @param trailing_slash_handling A character string specifying how to handle
#'   trailing slashes in the path component of the cleaned URL. Defaults to
#'   "none".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"none": (Default) No specific handling is applied. Path remains as
#'     is after initial parsing.}
#'     \item{"keep": Ensures a trailing slash. If a path exists and doesn't end
#'     with one, it's added. If path is just "/", it's kept.}
#'     \item{"strip": Removes a trailing slash if present, unless the path is
#'     solely "/".}
#'   }
#' @param index_page_handling A character string specifying how to handle
#' index/default pages. Defaults to "keep".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"keep": (Default) Leave index/default page segments untouched.}
#'     \item{"strip": Remove a trailing index.* or default.* segment
#'     (case-insensitive).}
#'   }
#' @param path_normalization How to normalize path structure. Defaults to
#' "none". rurl owns dot-segment resolution: the path is read from the input
#' verbatim (never from a pre-normalized path), so \code{"none"} preserves
#' \code{.} / \code{..} segments (\code{/a/../b} stays \code{/a/../b}) and only
#' the settings below change them. Resolution follows RFC 3986 section 5.2.4 and
#' acts on \emph{literal} \code{.}/\code{..} segments only — a percent-encoded
#' \code{\%2e} is a normal path byte, never a dot segment, so it is never
#' treated as traversal.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"none": (Default) No normalization; dot and slash structure is
#'     preserved exactly as written.}
#'     \item{"collapse_slashes": Collapse duplicate slashes in the path.}
#'     \item{"dot_segments": Resolve . and .. segments per RFC 3986.}
#'     \item{"both": Apply both collapse_slashes and dot_segments.}
#'   }
#' @param scheme_relative_handling How to handle URLs starting with "//".
#' Defaults to "keep".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"keep": Parse using http but return scheme as NA and set status to
#'     "ok-scheme-relative".}
#'     \item{"http": Assume http for parsing and output.}
#'     \item{"https": Assume https for parsing and output.}
#'     \item{"error": Treat scheme-relative URLs as invalid.}
#'   }
#' @param host_encoding How to present the host in `clean_url`. Defaults to
#' "keep".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"keep": Leave the host as parsed (may preserve original case).}
#'     \item{"idna": Convert Unicode host labels to Punycode (IDNA) for the
#'     cleaned URL.}
#'     \item{"unicode": Decode Punycode labels to Unicode for the cleaned URL.}
#'   }
#'   Under `url_standard = "whatwg"` every value renders the UTS-46-mapped
#'   host, because mapping is part of WHATWG host parsing rather than a
#'   feature of the `idna` dial (`BÜCHER.example` presents as
#'   `bücher.example`; RUL-002). There `"keep"` preserves only whether the
#'   input was written as an A-label (`xn--...`), so `get_host()` and
#'   `get_domain()` agree on the same row. `"rfc3986"` and `NULL` are
#'   unaffected.
#' @param path_encoding How to present the path percent-encoding in `clean_url`
#' — the readable-vs-browser rendering choice (the path analog of
#' `host_encoding`). Defaults to "keep". This is an orthogonal presentation
#' knob: it is independent of `url_standard` and layers on top of any profile
#' (e.g. `url_standard = "whatwg", path_encoding = "encode"` emits the
#' WHATWG-parsed path in browser form), exactly like `host_encoding`. Only
#' "keep" preserves a profile's canonical identity path verbatim; "encode" and
#' "decode" are presentation forms that may re-encode or decode reserved octets
#' (so `%2F` may fold to a path-separating `/`), independent of whether a
#' profile is set.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"keep": Leave the path percent-encoding untouched (the path is
#'     preserved as written in the URL, so `%2F` stays `%2F` rather than
#'     decoding into a path-separating `/`). With no `url_standard`, rurl keeps
#'     its historical RFC-style percent-hex case canonicalization, so `%2f`
#'     becomes `%2F`. Under `url_standard = "rfc3986"`, the profile's RFC 3986
#'     §6.2.2.2 normalization applies: a triplet encoding an unreserved byte is
#'     decoded, every other triplet stays encoded with uppercased hex, so
#'     `%7E` becomes `~` while `%2F` stays `%2F`. Under
#'     `url_standard = "whatwg"`, existing percent-triplet
#'     spelling is preserved byte-for-byte. Use "encode" to additionally
#'     normalize which bytes are encoded.}
#'     \item{"encode": The browser/percent-encoded rendering. Decodes the path
#'     first, then percent-encodes each segment (slashes preserved), so a
#'     readable non-ASCII path is emitted in its percent-encoded UTF-8 form.}
#'     \item{"decode": The readable rendering. Percent-decodes UTF-8 sequences
#'     in the path, so a percent-encoded segment is shown as readable text.}
#'   }
#' @param subdomain_levels_to_keep An integer or NULL. Determines how many
#' levels of subdomains are kept,
#'   in addition to any 'www.' prefix handled by `www_handling`.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{`NULL`: (Default) No specific subdomain stripping is performed
#'     beyond `www_handling`.}
#'     \item{`0`: All subdomains are stripped. If `www_handling` preserved or
#'     added 'www.',
#'          it remains (e.g., 'www.sub.example.com' becomes 'www.example.com';
#'          'sub.example.com' becomes 'example.com').}
#'     \item{`N > 0`: Keeps up to N levels of subdomains, counted from
#'     right-to-left (closest to the registered domain),
#'          in addition to any 'www.' prefix. E.g., if N=1,
#'          'three.two.one.example.com' becomes 'one.example.com';
#'          'www.three.two.one.example.com' (post www_handling) becomes
#'          'www.one.example.com'.}
#'   }
#' @param query_handling A character string controlling whether (and how) the
#' query string is included in `clean_url`. Defaults to "drop", which preserves
#' the historical query-free `clean_url`. The raw `query` result field is never
#' affected by this option — it always reports the faithful original query.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"drop": (Default) `clean_url` carries no query, exactly as before.}
#'     \item{"filter": Keep contentful params, dropping known trackers via a
#'     built-in denylist (e.g. `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`). `params_drop`
#'     extends the denylist; `params_keep` rescues names (winning over both the
#'     denylist and empty-dropping).}
#'     \item{"allow": Keep only params whose names match `params_keep`; all
#'     others are dropped. Here `params_keep` is an inclusion criterion only,
#'     not an empty-rescue.}
#'     \item{"keep": Keep every param, re-encoded into canonical form (not the
#'     verbatim original — that stays on the `query` field).}
#'   }
#'   In every non-"drop" mode the surviving query is re-encoded canonically
#'   (uppercase percent-hex, spaces as `%20`) and appended after the path. The
#'   query is intentionally EXEMPT from `case_handling` (query values are
#'   case-sensitive — tokens, IDs, signatures), so under
#'   `case_handling = "lower"` or `"upper"` the `clean_url` is no longer
#'   uniformly cased: scheme/host/path fold but the query keeps its original
#'   case. Because `clean_url` is the \code{\link{canonical_join}} key, any
#'   non-"drop" mode also brings the query into that join key (so `?id=1` and
#'   `?id=2` stop collapsing, while `utm`-only differences still collapse under
#'   "filter").
#' @param params_keep Character vector of parameter-name globs (only `*` is
#'   special), or `NULL` (default). In "filter" mode this is the rescue list; in
#'   "allow" mode it is the allowlist. Ignored in "drop"/"keep".
#' @param params_drop Character vector of parameter-name globs to add to the
#'   built-in denylist in "filter" mode, or `NULL` (default). Ignored in
#'   "drop"/"allow"/"keep".
#' @param sort_params Logical (default `FALSE`). When `TRUE`, surviving params
#'   are stably sorted by decoded key. Active in "filter"/"allow"/"keep".
#' @param empty_param_handling One of "keep" (default) or "drop". "drop" removes
#'   empty-valued params (e.g. `?ref=`), except those rescued by `params_keep`
#'   in "filter" mode.
#' @param params_case_sensitive Logical (default `FALSE`). Controls whether the
#'   denylist and `params_keep`/`params_drop` matching is case-sensitive.
#' @param decode_plus Logical (default `FALSE`). When `TRUE`, `+` in query
#'   values is treated as a space (HTML-form decoding) before percent-decoding.
#'   `FALSE` keeps `+` literal (RFC 3986 generic behavior).
#' @param port_handling A character string controlling whether the port
#' appears in `clean_url`. Defaults to "exclude", today's only historical
#' behavior. This knob is standalone and standard-independent (editorial, like
#' `www_handling`) -- `url_standard` never governs whether it may be set.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"exclude": (Default) The port never appears in `clean_url`.}
#'     \item{"strip_all": Explicit alias of "exclude".}
#'     \item{"keep": Include the syntactic port when present, including a
#'     default port under `url_standard = "whatwg"`. This is an explicit
#'     non-parity override for callers that need the input's port spelling.}
#'     \item{"strip_default": Keep only non-default ports (using the same
#'     scheme-default table), independent of `url_standard`. Default-ness is
#'     judged on the scheme the input was **parsed** with, never on the scheme
#'     `protocol_handling` renders: `http://example.com:443/a` under
#'     `protocol_handling = "https"` keeps `:443`, and `http://example.com:80/a`
#'     drops `:80` (RFC 3986 §6.2.3; WHATWG URL Standard port state; RUL-016).
#'     This is the value `profile = "seo"` pins.}
#'   }
#' @param scheme_policy Controls whether scheme-less, host-shaped input is
#' *accepted* (an input-acceptance axis, distinct from `protocol_handling`,
#' which only controls how the scheme is *presented*, and from `url_standard`,
#' which controls interpretation). Defaults to "infer".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"infer": (Default) Fabricate `http://` for scheme-less host-shaped
#'     input (e.g. `example.com` parses as `http://example.com`), a
#'     browser-omnibox-style affordance. This is the historical behavior.}
#'     \item{"require": Reject scheme-less input — a scheme-less host-shaped
#'     value becomes `parse_status = "error"` rather than gaining a fabricated
#'     scheme. Use this for a strict, pure-parser posture. Note this governs
#'     only bare host input; scheme-relative `//host` input is governed
#'     separately by `scheme_relative_handling`.}
#'   }
#' @param scheme_acceptance Which scheme *tokens* may enter parsing (a
#' scheme-acceptance axis, distinct from `scheme_policy`, which governs
#' scheme-*less* input, and from `url_standard`, which governs interpretation).
#' Defaults to "web".
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"web": (Default) Only the curated web-scheme allowlist
#'     (`http`/`https`/`ftp`/`ftps`/`file`) is admitted; a scheme-bearing input
#'     outside it is `parse_status = "error"`. This is the historical,
#'     byte-for-byte compatible behavior.}
#'     \item{"general": Admit any syntactically valid scheme token and parse
#'     opaque (`mailto:x`), non-special (`foo://host`), and RFC-generic URLs.
#'     Requires an explicit `url_standard` (`"rfc3986"` or `"whatwg"`), which
#'     decides the interpretation; `general` with `url_standard = NULL` is an
#'     error. Non-special / opaque hosts receive no www-stripping, no domain/TLD
#'     derivation, and are never run through the IDNA/punycode helpers.
#'     A non-special scheme with no `//` is an *opaque path*: it has no
#'     authority, so `host`, `user`, `port` and the `domain`/`tld` columns are
#'     all `NA` and the entire remainder is the `path` (`query`/`fragment` are
#'     still split off). This includes `mailto:` — the recipient's `@` never
#'     re-triggers authority parsing. To decompose a `mailto:` recipient, use
#'     the accessors (`get_host()` / `get_domain()` / `get_user()`, ADR 0012 D7)
#'     or `get_mailto_recipients()`; those deliberately return a recipient's
#'     parts where this table presents `NA`, because a recipient domain is
#'     extraction metadata, not the URL's authority.}
#'   }
#'   Note that `file:` is admitted under *both* values, including the default.
#'   A `file:` URL denotes local-filesystem access, and one with a non-empty
#'   host (`file://server/share/x`) is a UNC path on Windows, so dereferencing
#'   it reaches a remote SMB share. rurl parses `file:` URLs; it never opens
#'   them. Restricting schemes before anything dereferences them is the
#'   caller's job — see `SECURITY.md`.
#' @param url_standard Optional top-level standard profile: `NULL` (default),
#'   `"rfc3986"`, or `"whatwg"`. With `NULL` the behavior is exactly what the
#'   individual low-level options select (fully backward compatible). When set,
#'   it selects a coherent set of standard-conformant behaviors for the axes it
#'   governs — path percent/dot handling, the host IPv4/reg-name model, and
#'   `case_handling` — so callers do not have to hand-assemble the low-level
#'   knobs. Passing a governed low-level knob (`path_normalization` or
#'   `case_handling`) with a value the selected
#'   profile would not choose is an error; passing the value the profile would
#'   pick is accepted (only `case_handling = "lower_host"` is accepted under a
#'   selector — `"keep"`, `"lower"`, and `"upper"` all conflict, since `"lower"`
#'   also lowercases the path, which neither standard sanctions). Added as the
#'   last argument so existing positional calls keep their meaning; always
#'   pass it by name. Under `"whatwg"` the selector additionally recognizes a
#'   literal backslash as a path separator for WHATWG-special schemes
#'   (`http`/`https`/`ftp`) and nulls default ports in parse output; use
#'   `port_handling = "strip_default"` for spec-style clean URL port rendering.
#'   See \code{\link{resolve_url}} for `url_standard`-governed
#'   reference resolution. The selector does **not** govern whether
#'   `port_handling` may be set (it is a standalone editorial knob), nor does it
#'   govern `path_encoding` (an orthogonal path-presentation knob that layers
#'   on any profile), IDNA rendering, or query handling.
#' @param engine Optional \pkg{pslr} engine controlling which Public Suffix List
#'   backs domain / TLD / subdomain extraction: `NULL` (default) resolves
#'   against \pkg{pslr}'s session-global default list — exactly the historical
#'   behavior — while a `pslr::psl_engine()` snapshot resolves against that
#'   specific list, per request, without mutating any global state (never call
#'   `pslr::psl_use()` for this). Use it to pin a particular list version or to
#'   load an alternate list via `pslr::psl_engine(source = "path", path = ...)`.
#'   **Process-local:** an engine holds a C++ external pointer that does **not**
#'   serialize across R sessions or parallel workers — build it in the process
#'   that uses it; never cache it to disk or send it to a worker (rebuild one
#'   per process instead). Only the domain-derived outputs (`domain`, `tld`,
#'   and the subdomain-trimmed host / `clean_url`) depend on it.
#' @param profile Optional named profile bundling several knobs at once: `NULL`
#'   (default; behaves exactly as the individual arguments select, fully
#'   backward compatible), `"browser"`, `"whatwg"`, `"rfc-syntax"`, `"seo"`, or
#'   the `"seo"` alias `"canonical"`. A profile is **separate** from
#'   `url_standard` (it bundles acceptance, interpretation, leniency, and
#'   canonicalization together) and expands only into arguments you did not
#'   supply explicitly — an explicit argument always overrides the profile.
#'   `"browser"` is a browser-*like* fix-up posture (http-prepending; not
#'   Chrome-faithful); `"whatwg"` is the absolute-URL no-base posture that
#'   *rejects* scheme-less input (unlike a bare `url_standard = "whatwg"`);
#'   `"rfc-syntax"` is RFC 3986 generic syntax as parsing, not normalization
#'   (case and dot-segments are preserved); `"seo"`/`"canonical"` is rurl's
#'   origin-cleaning intent — a **lossy policy projection of a WHATWG-parsed
#'   URL** (ADR 0017), which claims no resource equivalence:
#'   `url_standard = "whatwg"` underneath (which also resolves `.`/`..` folder
#'   segments), https, a Unicode host regardless of the input spelling,
#'   strip www / trailing slash / index page, drop the whole query, and drop
#'   a **default** port only (`port_handling = "strip_default"`: a
#'   non-default port names a different origin and survives). Inspect
#'   the resolved bundle with
#'   \code{\link{url_profile}}. Also accepted by \code{\link{canonical_join}}
#'   (forwarded through its \code{...}).
#' @param credential_handling How `clean_url` treats a URL whose parsed
#'   authority carried a userinfo delimiter (`user@`, `user:password@`, a bare
#'   `@`, or a repeated `@`). Defaults to "strip". A policy dial on the clean
#'   surface (ADR 0017, mutation-table row 12; RUL-001), not a standards axis:
#'   it composes with every `url_standard`, including `NULL`, and never
#'   touches the `user` / `password` columns, `parse_status`, the diagnostics,
#'   \code{\link{serialize_url}} or \code{\link{get_url_key}}.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{"strip": (Default) The userinfo is dropped and the rest of the
#'     URL is emitted, exactly as before this argument existed.}
#'     \item{"reject": `clean_url` is `NA` for such a row. RFC 3986 section
#'     3.2.1 deprecates the `user:password` form and lets an application
#'     reject it; sections 7.5 and 7.6 describe the credential leak and the
#'     `https://example.com@evil.example/` semantic attack a silently
#'     collapsed clean URL would hide. Use this when a cleaned URL that
#'     \emph{looks} like the credential-free original would be misleading.}
#'   }
#'   There is no "keep": \code{\link{serialize_url}} already preserves
#'   credentials under both standards, and \code{\link{format_url}} redacts
#'   them for display.
#' @return A named list with the following components:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `original_url`: The original URL string provided.
#'     \item `scheme`: The scheme (e.g., "http", "https").
#'     \item `host`: The host (e.g., "www.example.com"). NA if the host becomes
#'     empty after processing.
#'     \item `port`: The port number.
#'     \item `path`: The path component (e.g., "/path/to/resource").
#'     \item `query`: The query string (e.g., "name=value"); never
#'     percent-decoded. Under `url_standard = "whatwg"` it carries the
#'     standard's percent-encoded spelling (the query percent-encode set is
#'     applied, so a literal space reports as "%20"); under
#'     `url_standard = "rfc3986"` or no selector it is the raw source spelling,
#'     preserved byte-for-byte exactly as written in the URL (a bare key such
#'     as "flag" stays "flag", not "flag="). A present-but-empty query (e.g.
#'     from a trailing "?") is reported as NA.
#'     \item `fragment`: The fragment identifier (e.g., "section"); never
#'     percent-decoded, with the same two-branch contract as `query` (the
#'     fragment percent-encode set is applied under `url_standard = "whatwg"`,
#'     so a double-quote inside the fragment reports as "%22"). Empty is
#'     reported as NA.
#'     \item `user`: The user name for authentication; never percent-decoded.
#'     Under `url_standard = "whatwg"` it carries the standard's percent-encoded
#'     spelling (the userinfo percent-encode set is applied, so
#'     "http://a^b@host/" reports "a%5Eb"); under `url_standard = "rfc3986"` or
#'     no selector it is the raw source spelling, exactly as written in the URL.
#'     Empty is reported as NA.
#'     \item `password`: The password for authentication, with the same
#'     encoding contract as `user` (so a ":" inside a WHATWG password is
#'     reported as "%3A"). Empty is reported as NA.
#'     \item `domain`: The registered domain name (e.g., "example.com"). NA if
#'     host is an IP, empty, or derivation fails.
#'     \item `tld`: The top-level domain (e.g., "com"). NA if host is an IP,
#'     empty, or derivation fails.
#'     \item `domain_ascii`, `domain_unicode`: The registered domain in both
#'     canonical spellings, independent of `host_encoding`. For an
#'     internationalized domain, `domain_ascii` is the Punycode/A-label form
#'     (e.g., "xn--mnchen-3ya.de") and `domain_unicode` the decoded Unicode form
#'     (e.g., "münchen.de"); for an ASCII-only domain the two are equal.
#'     Unlike `domain` (which follows `host_encoding`, a rendering choice),
#'     these are stable identity keys — a Unicode host and its A-label share
#'     one `domain_ascii` — so consumers can build an encoding-independent key
#'     from a single parse. NA under the same conditions as `domain`.
#'     \item `tld_ascii`, `tld_unicode`: The public suffix (TLD) in both
#'     canonical spellings, the `tld` analogue of `domain_ascii`/
#'     `domain_unicode`. NA under the same conditions as `tld`.
#'     \item `is_ip_host`: Logical, TRUE if the host is an IP address.
#'     \item `clean_url`: A normalized canonical key reconstructed from
#'     scheme, host, and path, after processing and with case handling
#'     applied. The query is included only when `query_handling != "drop"`
#'     (the default is "drop", so by default the query is excluded); when
#'     included it is filtered/canonicalized per the query options and appended
#'     case-unfolded. The port is included only when
#'     `port_handling != "exclude"` (the default is "exclude", so by default
#'     the port is excluded, as before); fragment and userinfo are always
#'     excluded (use the dedicated components above to retrieve them). With
#'     `path_encoding = "decode"` the path is shown decoded, so `clean_url`
#'     is human-readable rather than guaranteed URL-safe. NA on a parse error,
#'     when the host is empty/NA except for a valid hostless `file:` URL, or
#'     under `credential_handling = "reject"` when the authority carried a
#'     userinfo delimiter.
#'     \item `parse_status`: Character string indicating parsing outcome
#'       ("ok", "ok-ftp", "ok-scheme-relative", "error", "warning-no-tld",
#'       "warning-invalid-tld", "warning-public-suffix", "warning-userinfo").
#'       "warning-userinfo" marks a scheme-less input carrying userinfo (e.g.
#'       "user@example.com"): host/domain/tld/user still resolve, but
#'       \code{clean_url} is NA (rurl will not fabricate a canonical URL from an
#'       ambiguous, email-shaped, scheme-less string).
#'   }
#'   Returns `NULL` if the URL is fundamentally unparseable (e.g., NA, empty)
#'   or uses a disallowed scheme.

# Build Stage A memoization cache keys for a vector of URLs from validated

# scheme_relative_handling), the www policy that shapes the post-www host fed to
# the PSL decomposition (www_handling), and the PSL section (tld_source). Every
# other option (case, trailing slash, index page, path normalization, path/host
# encoding, subdomain levels, and ALL seven query options) is a pure Stage-B
# presentation transform and is deliberately EXCLUDED, so profiles differing
# only in presentation share one cache entry. In particular the query engine
# (query_handling / params_keep / params_drop / sort_params /
# empty_param_handling / params_case_sensitive / decode_plus) reads only the
# cached raw query and shapes clean_url in Stage B, which is recomputed on every
# call -- so there is no memoized clean_url to go stale and the query options
# need not enter the key. (The PRD's self-delimiting cache-key serializer for
# the vector query options predates the parse/present split (RURL-dkwrebdt) that
# made clean_url a never-cached Stage-B output; it is obsolete here.) Single
# source of the field set, order, separator, and Unicode escaping so the key
# format cannot drift across call sites.
# Stable cache-key token for the per-request pslr engine (RURL-mhibnqbd). The
# Stage-A parse core caches the PSL decomposition (domain/TLD in both
# spellings), so an engine that resolves those against a DIFFERENT Public Suffix
# List MUST key a distinct cache entry -- otherwise a second call under another
# engine would reuse the first engine's memoized domain/TLD (a silent
# correctness bug). NULL (the session-global default) returns "" so the
# no-engine key stays byte-identical to the pre-engine format (mirroring how
# `opts$url_standard %||% ""` handles its NULL). A non-NULL engine is keyed by
# its snapshot identity (the sha256 of the PSL list content), which is stable
# across engine objects built from the same list -- so two engines over the
# same list share a cache entry (correct: identical PSL output) while different
# lists never collide. If a future pslr ever drops that field, fall back to the

# Neutralize bytes-marked input to NA before it can reach any string operation.

# inside `.cache_key_ascii()` throws "bytes encoding is not supported by this
# function" before the parse has even begun. That throw took the entire
# vectorized call with it -- `get_host()` over 1000 URLs lost all 1000 because
# one row carried a bytes mark (RURL-jttoigtc). Same broken promise as
# RURL-kmpnbvdl, at a different seam and with a different trigger: kmpnbvdl's
# guards scope on `validUTF8()` and on `Encoding()` being "UTF-8"/"latin1", and
# a "bytes" mark is neither, so they never see this row.
#
# NA, not a repair. There is no locale-free reading of a value whose author has
# declared it is not text, so `error` is the correct VERDICT here -- it is only
# the THROW that is wrong. Mapping to NA puts the row on the existing null-row
# path, where it reports `parse_status` "error" exactly like NA and "" input,
# and it costs no new column or field (ADR 0006).
#
# Deliberately NOT applied to `original_url`: safe_parse_urls() restores that
# column from the untouched input vector, so the caller still gets their own
# bytes back in the echo and can see WHICH row was refused.
#
# Idempotent and O(n) in C, so calling it at more than one seam is cheap. It has
# to be called at more than one, and that is MEASURED rather than assumed:
# `.mask_opaque_authority()` is a SIBLING consumer of the same input vector, not
# a caller of this funnel, and it walks the whole vector through
# `.has_explicit_authority()`'s `stri_replace_first_regex()` as soon as any one
# row is `mailto:`. With only the funnel guarded,

#                   scheme_acceptance = "general", url_standard = "whatwg")
#
# still threw. Note the shape of that reproducer: it is a CONJUNCTION (a mailto
# row AND a bytes row AND `scheme_acceptance = "general"`), and it fires on
# `safe_parse_urls()` but NOT on `get_host()`, which reaches the mask by a path
# the mailto branch does not arm. A one-input-at-a-time probe on the accessors
