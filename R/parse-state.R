# Internal parse STATE-MODEL vocabulary + pure classifiers (ADR 0012 Layer 3a,
# RURL-tzkcbvvt).
#
# This file is the foundation of Layer 3: it defines the internal state-model
# vocabulary and the pure, vectorized classifier functions that later layers
# CONSUME -- L3b (serializers), L3c (the Stage-B eligibility matrix), and L4b
# (host parsers). It is deliberately ADDITIVE: nothing here is wired into the
# live parse pipeline yet, so byte-identity of every existing output is
# trivially preserved. The classifiers are PURE: they take already-decomposed
# pieces (scheme special-ness, the remainder after the scheme, an isolated host,
# a `//` flag, a raw component value) and never parse, never touch the web
# parser, and
# never route through the punycode/domain helpers (ADR 0002).
#
# Why a richer state model at all: ADR 0012 D2 shows a single `opaque` boolean
# CANNOT round-trip the four WHATWG non-special shapes -- `foo:bar` (opaque,
# host absent), `foo:/bar` (list, host absent, no authority), `foo:///bar`
# (list, host EMPTY, authority present), `foo://[::1]/bar` (list, IPv6 host).
# `authority_delimiter_present` records whether a `//` authority delimiter was
# present (distinguishing `foo:/bar` from `foo:///bar`) and
# `authority_payload_kind` whether that delimiter carried anything;
# `host_kind` records empty-vs-absent-vs-present WITHIN an authority. Neither
# derives the other across all four shapes, so both are retained. Public `NA`
# mapping is unchanged: both empty and absent hosts, and both empty and absent
# query/fragment, still surface as `NA` publicly -- this vocabulary is internal
# state only.

# --- enum vocabularies (first value = the natural default) ------------------

# --- pure, vectorized classifiers -------------------------------------------

# All classifiers below are written as pre-allocate + logical-mask assignment

# common length so mixed scalar-and-vector calls (as the tests use) work.

# WHATWG opaque-path trigger (ADR 0012 D2 / Appendix A.1, WHATWG
# #opaque-path-state). A URL's path is `opaque` iff the scheme is NON-special
# AND the remainder after the scheme `:` does NOT start with `/`; otherwise
# `list`. `remainder_after_scheme` is the input after the scheme `:` (e.g. for
# `foo:bar` it is "bar", for `foo:/bar` it is "/bar", for `foo:///bar` it is
# "///bar"). Special schemes are always `list`. A missing (NA) remainder is
# treated as not starting with `/`.

#
# Per-row eligibility masks that gate the Stage-B semantic-transform pipeline
# (._parse_stage_b_vec, R/parse.R). This is a PURE, vectorized classifier: it
# takes already-classified per-row state (scheme string, WHATWG path_kind via
# `.whatwg_path_kind`, host_kind via `.host_kind`, is_ip_host) plus the resolved
# `scheme_acceptance`/`url_standard`, and returns three logical masks. It never
# parses, never touches the web parser, and never routes through the
# punycode/domain
# helpers (ADR 0002).
#
# CRITICAL BYTE-IDENTITY DESIGN: the ENTIRE restriction is gated on
# `scheme_acceptance == "general"`. Under any other value (notably "web", the
# only publicly reachable value and the default), ALL masks are TRUE -- the
# previously supported web schemes (http/https/ftp/ftps/file) are GRANDFATHERED
# and keep exactly today's Stage-B behavior (D2: "without changing existing
# direct-selector results for the previously supported schemes"). This mirrors
# L2's reject decoupling (`if (scheme_acceptance == "web")`, parse-phases.R):
# byte-identity for web is BY CONSTRUCTION, not by hoping masks come out TRUE.
#
# Returns a list of three masks, each length-n:
#   - path_eligible: hierarchical/path transforms (dot-segment normalization,
#     index page, trailing slash, and the path case fold). D2 row "Hierarchical
#     path transforms": never applied to a WHATWG opaque path; TRUE for list
#     paths.
#   - host_transform_eligible: host presentation (host_encoding IDNA/unicode),
#     subdomain trimming, and the host case fold. D2 rows "Host presentation
#     (host_encoding)" + "DNS/PSL derivation": a WHATWG *domain* host only. A
#     domain host arises only under a special scheme; opaque hosts (non-special
#     scheme), IP literals, and empty/absent hosts are NOT domain hosts.
#   - semantic_transform_eligible: automatic semantic transforms beyond the
#     standard (query filter/sort here; www/subdomain/scheme-force are Stage A
#     or covered by the host mask). D2 row "Automatic semantic transforms":
#     HTTP(S) only (ftp/file are special but not HTTP(S)). This FALSE case is

#
# `.rfc3986_generic_uri_ok()` is the INDEPENDENT normative acceptance contract
# for the new RFC-general branch (ADR 0012 D1, lines 199-226). After scheme +
# component-delimiter recognition it validates that the ASCII portion of the
# input matches RFC 3986's generic `URI` grammar (RFC 3986 section 3). It is a
# PURE, vectorized validator: it NEVER runs the web parser and never delegates
# to its permissiveness (D1: "an INDEPENDENT gate, not a delegation to the
# parser"). It is deliberately ADDITIVE -- nothing here is wired into the live
# parse pipeline (L4b does that), so byte-identity of every existing output is
# trivially preserved.
#
# It is NOT wired to the punycode/domain helpers (ADR 0002) and does NOT touch
# them. It is NOT an RFC 3987 (IRI) validator: directly-written non-ASCII scalar
# values are the ONE tolerated syntax extension (ADR 0002 reversibility) --
# carried through and flagged `unicode-outside-rfc3986-uri`, never advertised as
# IRI conformance. That tolerance does NOT relax the surrounding ASCII grammar.
#
# Return value: list(ok = <logical>, diagnostic = <character>), each length-n.
#   - ok        : TRUE = accepted by the generic URI grammar; FALSE = a generic
#                 grammar violation; NA = NA input.

#                 otherwise (including every rejected row).
#
# DELIBERATE ABNF SIMPLIFICATIONS (documented per the task):
#   * Component validation is per-component character-class + pct-encoding regex
#     plus explicit delimiter checks, not a byte-perfect ABNF derivation. Every
#     RURL-wncwfasl false-reject and every adversarial fixture is covered, and
#     the adversarial rejects are rejected.
#   * IPv4address is subsumed by `reg-name` for ACCEPTANCE (a dotted quad is a
#     valid reg-name: digits + "." are unreserved), so a distinct IPv4 grammar
#     is not needed for the gate's verdict.
#   * IPv6 uses the canonical fully-expanded alternation (RFC 4291 textual
#     forms incl. `::` compression + trailing embedded IPv4); zone identifiers
#     are unsupported (RFC 9844 restored RFC 3986's zone-less `IP-literal`).
#   * Scheme-specific restrictions are NOT generic gates (D1 rule 6): a

# Pin the byte->code-point reading this grammar walks, so the VERDICT does not
# depend on the session locale (RURL-kmpnbvdl).
#
# The walk mixes two indexing schemes: `stri_locate_first_fixed()` /
# `stri_detect_regex()` count CODE POINTS (stringi decodes first), while
# `substring()` / `nchar()` count NATIVE characters. For a string marked
# "unknown" -- which is what `rawToChar()` and most user input produce -- native
# means the session encoding, so `<C3><A9>` is ONE character under a UTF-8
# locale and TWO under `LC_ALL=C`. The two schemes then disagree and the
# grammar slices the authority at the wrong offset: `ftp://é:é@example.com/p`
# was admitted (`ok-ftp`) under a UTF-8 session and REJECTED (`error`) under
# `LC_ALL=C`, on byte-identical input.
#
# `\x{0080}-\x{10FFFF}` in the data class admits directly-written non-ASCII
# SCALAR VALUES, and a scalar value only exists once an encoding is fixed. UTF-8
# is that encoding everywhere else in the package (`.mark_host_utf8()`,
# `.web_high_bytes_ok()`), so declaring it here makes the gate agree with the
# parser it gates instead of with whoever set LC_CTYPE.
#
# `Encoding<-`, never `enc2utf8()`: the bytes must not move, only their reading
# be fixed -- `enc2utf8()` TRANSCODES from the session locale, which is the very
# sensitivity being removed. Only "unknown" (native) elements are touched: an
# explicit "UTF-8"/"latin1"/"bytes" declaration is already locale-invariant and
# is the caller stating what the bytes mean, so it stands. Invalid octets stay
# invalid -- a declared-UTF-8 string holding `<80>` makes `stri_detect_regex()`
# return NA, `isTRUE()` folds that to FALSE, and the row is rejected in EVERY

# --- Posture host/opaque parsers (ADR 0012 Layer 4b, RURL-yutinyhb) ----------
#
# The HOST/OPAQUE decomposition functions the (still-unexposed) `general`
# acceptance will call. They are PURELY ADDITIVE: nothing here is wired into the
# live Stage-A routing, public signatures, `.derive_parse_status_vec`, or the
# Phase-11 serializer dispatch (that is the SEPARATE activation unit,
# RURL-qbnelzku). Byte-identity of every existing output is therefore trivially
# preserved. They NEVER route a non-special / opaque / reg-name host through the
# punycode or domain.R helpers (ADR 0002 -- hard): the opaque host is UTF-8
# percent-encoded, the RFC host is source-preserving, and ASCII case is kept in
# both (case policy is a separate phase).
#
# `.parse_opaque_urls_vec(url, url_standard)` returns a COLUMNAR list (each
# element length-n): decomposed components plus the internal STATE kinds. The
# activation unit reads the posture-appropriate columns:
#   - ok            : logical; FALSE = a host parse failure (forbidden-host cp,
#                     or a malformed bracketed IP literal) OR an un-decomposable
#                     input (missing scheme / NA). The four legal WHATWG shapes
#                     and every legal RFC host are ok = TRUE.
#   - scheme        : the source scheme spelling (case preserved; posture case
#                     policy is applied later).
#   - host          : NA (absent) / "" (empty) / value. WHATWG opaque hosts are
#                     UTF-8 %-encoded; RFC hosts are source-preserving.
#   - port          : NA (absent) / "" / digits (source-preserving string).
#   - path          : the path body (opaque path is the whole remainder string).
#   - query/fragment: NA (absent) / "" (empty-but-present) / value.
#   - path_kind     : WHATWG list/opaque (`.whatwg_path_kind`); NA under RFC.
#   - rfc_path_form : RFC abempty/absolute/rootless/empty (`.rfc_path_form`); NA
#                     under WHATWG.
#   - host_kind     : `.host_kind` (absent/empty/present).
#   - authority_delimiter_present : logical; was a `//` authority delimiter
#                     present after the scheme `:` (P1.2 D-A.1). This is the
#                     fact the L3b serializers consume to decide `//` emission.
#   - authority_payload_kind : empty (the authority substring under a present
#                     `//` is zero-length) / present (it carries anything at
#                     all) / NA when no delimiter was present (P1.2 D-A.2).

# RFC 8089 `file:` overlay (ADR 0012 D1 / A.2, RURL-yutinyhb; two-gate model
# RURL-obsweger). A THIN overlay used wherever `file:` is routed off the web
# under the RFC model (`url_standard = "rfc3986"` and the NULL selector) -- the
# WHATWG `file:` path (`.parse_whatwg_file_urls_vec`) is a SEPARATE state
# machine and is left verbatim.
#
# RFC 8089 is a SPECIALIZATION of RFC 3986, not a parallel model: its normative
# Section 2 grammar is built from RFC 3986's own productions and is a strict
# SUBSET of them. Its Appendix E/F "nonstandard variations" are the opposite --
# they partly escape the generic envelope (App. F's `drive-letter = ALPHA ":" /
# ALPHA "|"` is not valid RFC 3986: `|` is absent from `pchar`). So acceptance
# is decided by TWO gates, in order:
#
#   Gate 1 -- is the string a valid RFC 3986 URI at all? No -> parse failure.
#     Rejects the backslash separator (App. E.4 states it is "forbidden by both
#     [RFC1738] and [RFC3986]" and offers only a repair heuristic, never a
#     production), the `ALPHA "|"` drive letter, and a literal `[example]` host.
#     Verified against independent implementations: Ruby's URI::RFC3986_Parser
#     rejects all three; Node/WHATWG repairs them (which is the `whatwg`
#     profile's job here, not ours).
#
#   Gate 2 -- does RFC 8089 Section 2 narrow it further? Enforce that narrowing,
#     UNLESS an Appendix F production restores the form AND the result is still
#     RFC 3986-valid.
#       port      -- REJECTED. Section 2's `file-auth = "localhost" / host`
#                    has no port and NO appendix supplies one.
#       userinfo  -- PARSED and surfaced as a fact. App. E.1/F supply
#                    `file-auth = "localhost" / [ userinfo "@" ] host`, and
#                    `userinfo` is an RFC 3986 production, so it stays inside
#                    the envelope. Reported via `file-userinfo-extension`.
#       query /   -- PARSED. RFC 8089 never mentions either (zero occurrences
#       fragment     in the document), so they are inherited generic RFC 3986
#                    components. For the fragment this is not merely silence:
#                    RFC 3986 Section 3.5 states that fragment semantics "are
#                    independent of the URI scheme and thus cannot be redefined
#                    by scheme specifications" -- RFC 8089 could not have
#                    restricted it. Real usage depends on this (RFC 8118
#                    Section 3 defines `page=`/`nameddest=` fragments for
#                    application/pdf, resolved by MEDIA TYPE exactly as 3986
#                    Section 3.5 describes). Reported via
#                    `file-component-outside-rfc8089`.
#
# No drive-letter or backslash rewriting (those are WHATWG-specific).
#
# What a `localhost` authority DECOMPOSES to, keyed on `url_standard` -- the
# same one-place shape as the `.web_*_policy()` mappers in R/parse-web.R, so
# the selector cannot mean two different grammars on two routes (ADR 0007).
#
#   "empty"     `localhost` collapses to an empty host. WHATWG's file host state
#               says "if host is localhost, set host to the empty string", and
#               the no-selector baseline reproduces it (byte-frozen, ADR 0012
#               D4).
#   "reg-name"  `localhost` is reported as itself, on the ordinary reg-name
#               seam. RFC 3986 S3.2.2 gives `reg-name` no special names, and
#               RFC 8089 S2's `file-auth = "localhost" / host` lists empty,
#               `localhost` and `host` as three legal authority FORMS -- it
#               never rewrites one into another. App. B makes
#               `file://localhost/p` EQUIVALENT to `file:///p`; equivalence is
#               not identical decomposition, and ADR 0007 puts `file` expansion
#               out of the selector's scope.
#
# ADR 0012 D5 scopes the collapse to WHATWG explicitly, by contrast with the
# `rfc-syntax` clause in the same bullet ("`file` under `rfc-syntax`:
# non-absolute path; userinfo, port, query, or fragment present ... Under
# WHATWG, `file://localhost/...` maps `localhost` to the empty host"). Layer
# 4b's "preserve WHATWG's `file://localhost/` -> empty-host mapping" is
# attributive -- it names the mapping's owner, and is not a mandate to run it
# under `rfc-syntax`. Emptying it there scored as the last `host`-field
# divergence in `tools/rfc3986-conformance-sweep.R` (RURL-zyytztdd).

# "scheme-specific facts (parseable != valid-for-the-scheme)" items for `file`
# under rfc-syntax. Keyed on the selector, exactly like
# `.rfc_file_localhost_policy()` above and for the same reason.
#
#   "reject"  a port is a parse FAILURE. RFC 8089 sec 2's

#             ADR 0012 D4.
#   "fact"    the port parses and is surfaced as a diagnostic. `rfc3986` is the
#             scheme-AGNOSTIC generic syntax, where `port = *DIGIT` and the
#             authority is well-formed, so an RFC 8089 narrowing may not gate
#             the parse: ADR 0012 (owner-ruled) "Scheme-specific restrictions
#             are overlays, not generic parse gates", and ADR 0012:63 has
#             scheme-specific RFC violations surface as companion facts
#             (ADR 0006).
#
# D5 lists userinfo, port, query and fragment TOGETHER. Three of the four were
# already facts -- `file://u@example.com/p` parses and reports
# `file-userinfo-extension`, `file:///p?q=1` reports
# `file-component-outside-rfc8089` -- and port was the lone exception, gating
# the parse instead (RURL-uhkofhjf). Same defect class as RURL-zyytztdd, where

# posture routes OFF the web route to the posture opaque/RFC/file parser;
# `.general_parse_vec` performs that parse and reports the components, the parse
# `ok` verdict (including D1's RFC generic-grammar gate), and the internal state
# kinds. BOTH Stage A and Stage B call `.general_parse_vec` on the same URL
# string, so the routing mask and state kinds are guaranteed consistent between
# the two stages WITHOUT threading every state kind through the Stage-A cache
# (the cache stores only `.spu_stage_a_fields`; these functions are pure and
# re-run cheaply in Stage B for the routed rows only).
#
# CRITICAL BYTE-IDENTITY DESIGN: both are a pure no-op unless
# `scheme_acceptance == "general"`. Under any other value (notably "web", the
# default and, until this unit, the only publicly reachable value) the mask is
# all-FALSE and the parse returns empty/NA columns, so the `general_route`
# masks in Stage A/B are EMPTY, web-route vectors are bit-identical, and no
# new behavior runs. Byte-identity for web is BY CONSTRUCTION.

# ROUTING RULE (posture-keyed). A row is general-routed iff it is scheme-bearing
# (`^scheme:`), is NOT a host:port form (`example.com:8080`, which Phase 1
# parses as host:port), and its scheme is NOT one the web route and the
# existing machinery already handle for the posture:
#   - whatwg  : keep the six WHATWG special schemes (http/https/ftp/ws/wss/file)
#               on the web route; route every other (non-special) scheme to

#               special (L1 default
#               ports 80/443); ftps is non-special under WHATWG and routes here.
#   - rfc3986 : keep http/https/ftp/ftps on the web route (existing host model
#               + path-rootless slice); route file to the RFC 8089 overlay and

#
# RFC 3986 sec 3.2: `authority = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]` and
# `host = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name`, where `reg-name = *( ... )` --
# `*`-quantified, so the EMPTY host is a well-formed authority. Appendix B reads
# every row above as authority-present with an empty host, and rurl already
# reports exactly that for the non-special twins (`foo://`,
# `foo://user@/www.example.com`) because those route to the general parser.
#
# These did not, so they hit the web route, which rejects an empty authority
# outright -- `.parse_web_url_one()` returns NULL. That is correct for the model
# the web route implements (a special-scheme authority always has a host) and
# wrong for RFC 3986's generic syntax, so it is the same ROUTING defect as the
# slash-run family and takes the same fix: send the row to the parser that is
# already right.
#
# The slash run is checked as EXACTLY 2 and the host-empty test is lexical,
# because a 2-slash run WITH a host is the ordinary web shape and must keep
# going to the web route untouched. `\A`/`\z`, not `^`/`$`, for the ICU
# trailing-line-terminator reason recorded throughout this file.
#
# This deliberately does NOT answer RURL-mugcdtrv, which asks whether the `web`
# POSTURE should admit such a row. That question is about ADR 0004's host-shape
# gate applied to rows that already parse; this is about rows that never reached
# a parser at all. After this change these 7 behave exactly like their
# already-shipped odd-slash siblings -- record `ok`, `general` posture `ok`,
# `web` posture still rejected -- so the posture question is left open, with
# these rows added to the set it governs rather than decided.

# RURL-xfbzkico. Under `rfc3986`, a web-route scheme whose post-scheme slash run
# is not EXACTLY 2 has no web-route shape at all, and the web route -- which
# models the special-scheme authority, not RFC 3986's generic syntax -- gets
# none of these right:
#
#   run  RFC 3986 sec 3 hier-part          web route reports
#   1    path-absolute, NO authority       host = first segment AND path = /seg
#   3    "//" empty-authority path-abempty host = first path segment (promotion)
#   >=4  "//" empty-authority path-abempty rejected outright
#
# The 1-slash case is the sharpest: the record claims
# `authority_delimiter_present = FALSE` while reporting a host, and leaves the
# same text in the path -- an internally incoherent record, and a decomposition
# no standard and no other engine produces.
#
# The fix is a ROUTING change rather than a second authority parser, because the
# general (RFC generic) parser already produces the exactly correct answer for
# every one of these shapes -- measured on the non-special twins, which differ
# only in scheme:
#
#   foo:/a           -> authority absent, path /a,          form `absolute`
#   foo:///a/b       -> authority EMPTY,  path /a/b,         form `abempty`
#   foo:////evil.com -> authority EMPTY,  path //evil.com,   form `abempty`
#
# So this routes to code that is already right and already covered, instead of
# teaching the web route a grammar it never modelled. It also fixes
# `rfc_path_form` for free (RURL-clgbpwla): the general route already reports
# `absolute` where the web route said `abempty`.
#
# A 0-slash run is INCLUDED as of RURL-kkuirsnz. `eb8ba1a` deliberately left it
# out -- the shape was nominally owned by the `prep$rfc3986_path_rootless` slice
# (`.rfc3986_path_rootless_vec()`, R/parse-phases.R) and widening it was a
# separate acceptance question. It is answered the same way as the rest of the
# family, and for the same reason: with no `//` there is no authority, RFC 3986
# sec 3.3's `hier-part` is `path-rootless`, and `@` and `:` are both `pchar`, so
# the whole remainder is a PATH.
#
# That slice stays, but it only ever claimed a NARROW subset -- a
# `.SPECIAL_AUTHORITY_SCHEMES` scheme whose first path segment is a DOTTED name
# -- so `http:example.com` worked while `http:@www.example.com`, `http:a:b@h`
# and `http::b@h` were rejected. The general parser is already right about all
# of them, and it is installed AFTER the slice in `.parse_urls_vec()`, so
# widening the routing lets ONE parser answer the whole family instead of a
# regex deciding which rootless paths are allowed to exist. Verified: on every
# shape the slice claims, the general parser returns the identical
# scheme/path/query/fragment.
#
# `whatwg` and the no-selector default are untouched -- the mask is gated on
# `url_standard == "rfc3986"` and returns all-FALSE for anything else, so both
# stay byte-identical by construction.
#
# It fires on EVERY acceptance posture, deliberately. Restricting it to
# `scheme_acceptance == "general"` (the first attempt) preserved `web`-posture
# bytes but split one selector across two grammars: `serialize_url(standard =
# "rfc3986")` gave the RFC answer while `safe_parse_urls(url_standard =
# "rfc3986")` still promoted the path segment into the host, and which you got
# depended on an unrelated axis. That is the "behaviour changes with the
# settings" failure mode, and it is worse than a characterization diff.
