# Reference resolution: resolve a relative or absolute URL reference against a
# base URL (RFC 3986 section 5), then canonicalize the result through the same
# url_standard-governed machinery as safe_parse_url(s). Everything downstream of
# the merge (path percent/dot handling, host IPv4/reg-name model, port elision,
# WHATWG backslash recognition, diagnostics) is delegated to safe_parse_urls().
#
# The merge itself is NOT standard-agnostic. PRD v2 D6 claimed it was and this
# file used to repeat the claim; decision P2.7 D-B
# (design/work/url-v3/decisions/P2.7-display-and-resolver-output.md) retires
# that claim against measurement -- WHATWG applies several rules while parsing
# the REFERENCE that RFC 3986 section 5 has no equivalent for. Those rules fire
# under `url_standard = "whatwg"` only; under "rfc3986" the merge is RFC 3986
# section 5.2-5.3 (P2.7 D-C).
#
# The SCHEME PRODUCTION is the one exception, and it splits on a different axis:
# `ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )` is RFC 3986 section 3.1's own
# grammar, identical to WHATWG's, so it is a conformance fix under BOTH named
# profiles rather than a WHATWG rule -- see `.split_uri_ref()`.
#
# The NULL selector is frozen byte-for-byte throughout (ADR 0007): no rule in
# this file, including the scheme production, is reachable from it.

# The scheme production, `ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )`. It is
# RFC 3986 section 3.1's own grammar and, byte for byte, WHATWG's "scheme start
# state" plus "scheme state" -- the two standards do not disagree here, which is
# why this constant carries no standard in its name. It is also already the
# production the ABSOLUTE-parse path uses everywhere (R/parse-state.R,
# R/url-key.R, R/serialize.R spell the same class inline); the resolver's
# splitter was the one place in the package reading a looser one.

# permissiveness is a defect for reference resolution specifically: a relative
# PATH whose first segment merely contains a colon (`10.0.0.7:8080/foo.html`,
# `[61:24:74]:98`) is read as a scheme, so section 5.2.2's first branch fires
# and the base is discarded. RFC 3986 section 4.2 names the hazard itself.

# Split a URI reference into its five components using the RFC 3986 Appendix B
# regular expression. Each of scheme / authority / query / fragment is either a
# string (the component was PRESENT, possibly empty) or NA (ABSENT -- e.g. no
# "//" means authority is NA, distinct from "" for "http:///"). `path` is always
# a string (RFC 3986 always matches a, possibly empty, path). Returns NA fields
# for an NA input.
#
# The SCHEME production is the one part that is not standard-agnostic, and not
# because the standards disagree -- they agree (`.URI_SCHEME_PRODUCTION`). What
# differs is what each SELECTOR is allowed to change:
#
#   * `"rfc3986"` and `"whatwg"` both get the real production. Under "rfc3986"
#     that is the RFC's own section 3.1 grammar replacing Appendix B's
#     self-described non-validating shorthand, so it is a conformance fix on the
#     profile's own terms, not an import from the other standard.
#   * `NULL` keeps Appendix B's loose group. It is observably looser -- under
#     the real production `resolve_url("10.0.0.7:8080/x", "http://a/b/c")`
#     stops being an absolute reference and starts merging against the base --
#     and the NULL selector is frozen byte-for-byte by ADR 0007. The freeze
#     governs whether the bytes may move, not whether they are right; the fix
#     ships on the two selectors that CLAIM a standard, and NULL is the surface

#
# It has TWO callers in `.resolve_one_raw()`, both gated on
# `.whatwg_special_base_scheme()`, because WHATWG reaches the same state chain
# two ways: with the base's own special scheme consumed ("special relative or
# authority state", `.whatwg_reference_is_relative()`) and with no scheme at all
# ("relative state" -> "relative slash state"). The scheme production below is
# absent either way, and the leading `sub()` is a no-op for the scheme-less
# entry, so one function serves both.
#
# Two deliberate departures from `.split_uri_ref()`:
#
#   * There is NO scheme production. That omission is the point: re-running the
#     full splitter on the remainder would re-read a first path segment that
#     happens to contain a colon as a scheme of its own, so `file:C:/` would
#     lose its `C:` and `http::@c:29` would grow a host.
#   * The authority is introduced by TWO leading `/`-or-`\` code points, either
#     of which may be a backslash, and it ends at the next `/ \ ? #`. That is
#     WHATWG's own authority entry for the state reached after a special scheme
#     is consumed, so it belongs to the rule implemented here rather than to the
#     separate backslash-in-reference family: `http:\\foo.com\` against an
#     `http:` base is `http://foo.com/`. Both departures are scoped to this
#     function, so a reference with NO scheme is untouched by either.
#
# `file` differs from the other five special schemes on exactly one point, which
# is why the scheme is a parameter: it has its own state machine (file state ->
# file slash state -> file host state) which consumes exactly TWO slashes, so
# `file:///x` has an EMPTY host and the path `/x`. The other five reach "special
# authority ignore slashes", which skips a run of ANY length, so `http:///x` has
# the host `x`.

# WHATWG parses a reference against a `file:` base through its own chain --
# "file state" -> "file slash state" -> "file host state" -> "path state" --
# and three of its rules have no RFC 3986 section 5 counterpart. All three are
# about Windows drive letters, and each is spelled once below:
#
#   * "file state": a scheme-less, slash-less reference that BEGINS with a
#     drive letter (`C|/foo`, `C|`, `C|?`, `C|#`) EMPTIES the base path instead
#     of shortening it, so the drive letter becomes the whole path
#     (`.whatwg_file_ref_starts_with_drive()`).
#   * "file slash state": a reference that is a lone `/`-rooted path (`/`,
#     `/x`) INHERITS the base's drive letter when the base path starts with a
#     normalized one and the reference does not (`.whatwg_file_base_drive()`).
#   * "shorten a URL's path": `..` never removes a path whose only segment is a
#     normalized drive letter, and "path state" rewrites `C|` to `C:` when it
#     is the first segment (`.whatwg_file_remove_dot_segments()`).
#
# The fourth rule, "file host state" -- an authority that IS a drive letter
# becomes an empty host plus a path segment -- lives in the ABSOLUTE parser
# (`.parse_whatwg_file_urls_vec()`, R/parse-phases.R), because the resolver's
# output is re-parsed there and the same rule applies to `file://C:/` typed
# directly. Every rule here is reached only from `.whatwg_special_base_scheme()`
# reporting `file`, so `"rfc3986"` and the frozen NULL selector never see them.

# WHATWG "Windows drive letter": two code points, an ASCII alpha then `:` or
# `|`. "Normalized" narrows the second to `:`. Both spellings are recognised
# where the standard's parsed base would already carry the normalized one
# (the base here is SPLIT, not parsed, so `file:///C|/a` arrives unnormalized).

# back a path whose FIRST segment is empty -- `/..//path` against `non-spec:/p`
# merges to `//path` -- and section 3.3 forbids exactly that string: "If a URI

#' Resolve a URL reference against a base URL
#'
#' Resolves a relative or absolute URL reference against a base URL following
#' the RFC 3986 section 5 reference-resolution algorithm, then renders the
#' resolved absolute URL on the output surface \code{output} selects. Under the
#' default \code{output = "clean"} the result is canonicalized with the same
#' machinery as \code{\link{safe_parse_url}}; under \code{output = "serialized"}
#' it is handed to \code{\link{serialize_url}} instead. \code{url_standard} and
#' any \code{...} options flow straight through to the parse, so the host
#' IPv4/reg-name model, path percent/dot-segment handling, default-port elision,
#' WHATWG backslash-as-slash recognition, and diagnostics are exactly those of a
#' direct \code{safe_parse_url()} call on the resolved URL.
#'
#' @section Reference resolution is standard-aware:
#'
#' The merge itself (empty reference, fragment-only, query-only, scheme-relative
#' \code{//host} reference, absolute-path reference, and relative-path merge) is
#' RFC 3986 section 5.2--5.3 under \code{url_standard = "rfc3986"} and under the
#' default \code{NULL} selector, with one exception under \code{"rfc3986"} noted
#' last below. Under \code{url_standard = "whatwg"} the WHATWG
#' URL Standard's reference-parsing rules are applied first, because they are
#' rules the two standards genuinely disagree on rather than composition of the
#' axes \code{url_standard} already governs (decision P2.7 D-B,
#' \code{design/work/url-v3/decisions/P2.7-display-and-resolver-output.md}):
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{A reference carrying the base's own special scheme is
#'     relative, not absolute.} WHATWG's \dQuote{special relative or authority
#'     state} consumes a scheme equal to the base's when that scheme is special
#'     (\code{http}, \code{https}, \code{ws}, \code{wss}, \code{ftp},
#'     \code{file}) and keeps parsing against the base, so
#'     \code{resolve_url("http:foo.com", "http://example.org/foo/bar",
#'     url_standard = "whatwg")} is \code{"http://example.org/foo/foo.com"},
#'     while RFC 3986 treats any scheme as making the reference absolute and
#'     gives \code{"http://foo.com/"}. A \emph{different} scheme stays absolute
#'     under both, even when it is also special.
#'   \item \strong{Under a special base, a leading \code{\\} in the reference is
#'     a \code{/}, and a run of either introduces an authority.} WHATWG's
#'     \dQuote{relative slash state} reads \code{\\} exactly as \code{/}, so
#'     \code{resolve_url("\\x", "http://example.org/foo/bar", url_standard =
#'     "whatwg", output = "serialized")} is \code{"http://example.org/x"}; a
#'     second slash-or-backslash enters the authority, and
#'     \dQuote{special authority ignore slashes} then skips the whole run for
#'     the five non-\code{file} special schemes, so \code{"///example.org/x"}
#'     and \code{"/\\/\\//example.org/x"} both resolve with the host
#'     \code{example.org}. \code{file} has its own state machine and consumes
#'     exactly two. RFC 3986 has neither rule: \code{\\} is an ordinary path
#'     byte and \code{//} is the entire authority production.
#'   \item \strong{The reference is stripped before it is read.} The WHATWG
#'     basic URL parser's step 1 removes a leading and trailing run of C0
#'     control or SPACE (U+0000--U+0020) and then every ASCII tab, LF and CR,
#'     so \code{" foo.com "} resolves as \code{"foo.com"} does. A reference that
#'     strips to the empty string is the empty reference, which resolves to the
#'     base minus its fragment. RFC 3986 has no strip step -- such bytes are
#'     required to be percent-encoded -- so under \code{"rfc3986"} and
#'     \code{NULL} they stay in the reference.
#'   \item \strong{Against a \code{file:} base, Windows drive letters follow
#'     the WHATWG \code{file:} state machine.} A reference that \emph{begins}
#'     with a drive letter empties the base path instead of shortening it, so
#'     \code{resolve_url("C|/foo", "file:///tmp/mock/path", url_standard =
#'     "whatwg", output = "serialized")} is \code{"file:///C:/foo"}; a rooted
#'     reference inherits the base's drive letter (\code{"/"} against
#'     \code{"file:///C:/a/b"} is \code{"file:///C:/"}); \code{..} never
#'     removes a lone drive letter (\code{".."} against \code{"file:///C:/"}
#'     is \code{"file:///C:/"}); and \code{C|} in the first segment is
#'     normalized to \code{C:}. A drive letter in the authority position
#'     (\code{"//d:"}) is an empty host plus a path segment,
#'     \code{"file:///d:"}. RFC 3986 has no drive-letter concept, so under
#'     \code{"rfc3986"} and \code{NULL} the plain section 5.2 merge applies.
#' }
#'
#' The \code{NULL} selector is frozen and unaffected (ADR 0007; P2.7 D-C):
#' every rule above is reachable only through
#' \code{url_standard = "whatwg"}.
#'
#' Two further rules apply under \strong{both} named profiles, because the two
#' standards agree on them. First, a resolved path whose first segment is
#' empty is recomposed with the \code{/.} guard: RFC 3986 section 3.3 forbids
#' a path beginning with \code{//} after no authority, and the WHATWG URL
#' serializer emits the same guard, so \code{resolve_url("/..//path",
#' "non-spec:/p", url_standard = "whatwg", output = "serialized")} is
#' \code{"non-spec:/.//path"} rather than a string that re-reads as the
#' authority \code{path}. The \code{NULL} selector recomposes the unguarded
#' string, as it always did. Second, a scheme is
#' \code{ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )} -- RFC 3986 section 3.1's
#' own grammar, and WHATWG's -- so a relative path whose first segment merely
#' \emph{contains} a colon is a path, not an absolute reference:
#' \code{resolve_url("[61:24:74]:98", "http://example.org/foo/bar",
#' url_standard = "whatwg", output = "serialized")} is
#' \code{"http://example.org/foo/[61:24:74]:98"}, and \code{"rfc3986"} merges
#' the same way. The \code{NULL} selector instead keeps RFC 3986 Appendix B's
#' explicitly \emph{non-validating} \code{[^:/?#]+}, which reads
#' \code{"10.0.0.7"} as a scheme and discards the base; that is frozen behavior
#' (ADR 0007), not a recommendation.
#'
#' @section Which output surface you want:
#'
#' \code{output} selects between two different products, not two settings of
#' one (decision P2.7 D-A,
#' \code{design/work/url-v3/decisions/P2.7-display-and-resolver-output.md}):
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{output = "clean"} (the default) returns the \emph{canonical}
#'     \code{clean_url} of the resolved reference, not a verbatim RFC 3986
#'     recomposition: as everywhere else in rurl, the fragment and userinfo are
#'     excluded from \code{clean_url}, the query is included only when
#'     \code{query_handling != "drop"} (the default drops it), and the port only
#'     when \code{port_handling != "exclude"}. This surface is
#'     \strong{intentionally lossy} -- it is a cleaning/SEO product driven by
#'     presentation policy, and it therefore \strong{cannot carry a conformance
#'     claim}. This differs from a generic resolver such as
#'     \code{xml2::url_absolute()} or Python's \code{urljoin}, which preserve
#'     every component verbatim; \code{resolve_url()} resolves \emph{and}
#'     canonicalizes.
#'   \item \code{output = "serialized"} returns
#'     \code{\link{serialize_url}(<resolved absolute URL>, standard =
#'     url_standard, form = form)}: the standard's own full-string
#'     serialization, with the fragment preserved and credentials
#'     reconstructed. This is the standards surface -- the one a conformance
#'     claim may be measured on -- and it is where RFC 3986 section 5.4's own
#'     expectations are reproduced exactly (\code{resolve_url("?y",
#'     "http://a/b/c/d;p?q", url_standard = "rfc3986", output = "serialized")}
#'     is \code{"http://a/b/c/d;p?y"}).
#' }
#'
#' \code{output = "serialized"} \strong{requires} an explicit
#' \code{url_standard}: \code{NULL} selects no standard, so there is nothing to
#' serialize \emph{to}, and the combination is an error rather than a silent
#' choice of one. Because \code{\link{serialize_url}} accepts no presentation
#' options at all, \code{output = "serialized"} also rejects any \code{...}
#' argument: honoring, say, \code{port_handling = "exclude"} is impossible on
#' that surface, and accepting-then-discarding it would misreport what was
#' returned.
#'
#' To inspect individual resolved components (including the fragment), resolve
#' first and pass the result to \code{\link{safe_parse_url}}.
#'
#' @param relative_or_absolute A character vector of URL references to resolve.
#'   Each may be relative (\code{"../b"}, \code{"?q=1"}, \code{"#frag"},
#'   \code{"//host/p"}) or already absolute (\code{"https://host/p"}); an
#'   absolute reference ignores \code{base_url}.
#' @param base_url A character vector of base URLs, recycled against
#'   \code{relative_or_absolute}. Each base must itself be an absolute URL
#'   (carry a scheme); a relative reference resolved against a scheme-less or
#'   \code{NA} base yields \code{NA}.
#' @param url_standard Optional standard profile forwarded to the parse:
#'   \code{NULL} (default), \code{"rfc3986"}, or \code{"whatwg"}. See
#'   \code{\link{safe_parse_url}} for the axes it governs, and
#'   \emph{Reference resolution is standard-aware} for the reference-parsing
#'   rules \code{"whatwg"} adds ahead of the merge. Required (non-\code{NULL})
#'   when \code{output = "serialized"}.
#' @param output Which output surface to return: \code{"clean"} (default,
#'   today's canonical \code{clean_url} bytes) or \code{"serialized"} (the
#'   selected standard's full-string serialization of the resolved absolute
#'   URL, via \code{\link{serialize_url}}). See \emph{Which output surface you
#'   want}.
#' @param form For \code{output = "serialized"} with
#'   \code{url_standard = "rfc3986"} only, the RFC posture forwarded to
#'   \code{\link{serialize_url}}: \code{"source"} (default, source-preserving)
#'   or \code{"normalized"}. Ignored for \code{"whatwg"}, whose serializer has a
#'   single spec-defined form, and ignored under \code{output = "clean"}, whose
#'   rendering is driven by the cleaning dials instead -- the same
#'   argument-is-inert-where-it-does-not-apply contract
#'   \code{\link{serialize_url}} itself holds for \code{form}.
#' @param ... Additional arguments forwarded to \code{\link{safe_parse_urls}}
#'   (e.g. \code{port_handling}, \code{query_handling}, \code{host_encoding}).
#'   Passing a governed low-level knob that conflicts with \code{url_standard}
#'   errors, exactly as it does for \code{\link{safe_parse_url}}. These are
#'   presentation dials consumed by the \code{"clean"} path only; supplying any
#'   of them together with \code{output = "serialized"} is an error, because
#'   \code{\link{serialize_url}} takes no presentation arguments and the dial
#'   could not be honored.
#' @return A character vector the same length as the recycled inputs, unnamed
#'   (names are not data). Under \code{output = "clean"} each element is the
#'   canonical \code{clean_url} of the resolved reference; under
#'   \code{output = "serialized"} it is the standard's full-string
#'   serialization of the resolved absolute URL. \code{NA} where resolution
#'   cannot produce an absolute URL, or where the resolved URL is not accepted
#'   by the parser (\code{"clean"}) or by the selected standard's parser
#'   (\code{"serialized"}).
